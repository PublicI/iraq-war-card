The hijackers crash a third into the Pentagon, just across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C.

This group usually included Cheney, Secretary of State [Colin] Powell, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, General Hugh Shelton, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs (later to become chairman) General [Richard] Myers, DCI [Director of Central Intelligence] [George] Tenet, Attorney General [John] Ashcroft, and FBI Director Robert Mueller. From the White House staff, National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice and Chief of Staff [Andrew] Card were part of the core group, often joined by their deputies, Stephen Hadley and Joshua Bolten. In this restricted National Security Council meeting, the president said it was a time for self-defense. The United States would punish not just the perpetrators of the attacks, but also those who harbored them. Secretary of State Powell said the United States had to make it clear to Pakistan, Afghanistan, and the Arab states that the time to act was now. He said we would need to build a coalition. The president noted that the attacks provided a great opportunity to engage Russia and China. Secretary Rumsfeld urged the president and the principals to think broadly about who might have harbored the attackers, including Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Sudan, and Iran. He wondered aloud how much evidence the United States would need in order to deal with these countries, pointing out that major strikes could take up to 60 days to assemble.",False,Iraq,"George W.

42,2001-10-08,White House Press Briefing by Ari Fleischer,"Question: How about the continuous playing of the Osama bin Laden tape? It is a rather inflammatory tape. It makes some very direct references to people in the Muslim world. Is there any concern that the president has about that message getting out repeatedly? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: No. There is nothing I have heard the president express about that. You know, the president saw the tape yesterday and his reaction to it is mostly that this is really not about Osama bin Laden; this is much broader than that. If Osama bin Laden was gone tomorrow, the war would continue beyond tomorrow. So that one person, that one tape, is not what this is about. This is an entire network of terrorists that has global reach and those who continue to harbor those terrorists who have carried out an attack on our country.

He's focusing on a multiple front effort that involves a series of actions to win this war on terrorism. <BR><BR>Question: This morning you said that the president believes bin Laden ""virtually"" took responsibility for the attacks in his speech which was aired yesterday.

And I don't think that surprises anybody. This is about an entire network that has people in place in some 60 countries, that presents a threat to the United States, that presents a threat to other nations around the world.

Is he still, as the president put it, only recently on a wanted dead-or-alive list? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: There has been no change in how the president thinks about that matter. <BR><BR>Question: So he still feels that he is wanted dead or alive? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: The president believes that on multiple fronts it is imperative for the United States and other nations around the world to take action, not only against one person, but against the entire network of terrorists. And that way we can help protect the world so these type of attacks don't happen again. <BR><BR>Question: But, previously, he went out of his way to single this guy out. <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: I've shared with you the president's thinking. <BR><BR>Question: Ari, going back to the same question, it seems like the White House is taking the onus off of Osama bin Laden by saying this is not really about one person. How can you say that when he is the head of this network, and how can you say that when this man has been on television saying what he will do if there is not peace in his country, there will not be peace here? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Because, April, if it wasn't this one man who was on television, he will be followed by another one man and another one man who is on television.

However, you are personally perceived as one of the few people in the administration who would like to enlarge the war in terrorism to include Iraq. Correct me, please. <BR><BR>Dr. Rice: Iraq has been a problem not just for U.S. policy, but for policy in the region, as well. This is a country that could not even acknowledge the right to exist of Kuwait. This is a country that has threatened its neighbors, that has been harmful to its own people. And we believe that our policies toward Iraq simply are to protect the region and to protect Iraq's people and neighbors. Now, we understood when we came to power here in Washington several months ago that we had a problem, for instance, on Iraqi sanctions; that people believed, or that Saddam Hussein was claiming that the sanctions that were in place were somehow harming the Iraqi people. We do not believe that they were harming the Iraqi people because in the north, where the U.N. administers the oil-for-food program, Iraqi people are doing well. It's only where Saddam Hussein administers oil-for-food that there is a problem with the Iraqi people. But that said, we want to change the sanctions. We want to change the sanctions so that they are aimed at the regime, which is a danger to its neighbors, not at the people. <BR><BR>Question: Other than that, there is no military action awaiting Iraq after all the military mobilization in the area as a second stage of this war on terrorism? <BR><BR>Dr. Rice: The president has made very clear that the war on terrorism is a broad war on terrorism.

Soon after the September 11 terrorist attacks, administration officials warned that if any link were discovered between the administration's prime suspect, Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda organization, and Iraq, the United States would not hesitate to retaliate.

61,2001-11-06,White House Press Briefing by Ari Fleischer,"Question: Ari, in many of the Pentagon briefings, we've been told in the last couple of weeks that the campaign is going well, that Al Qaeda is on the run, that members of the Taliban are not even able to effectively govern Afghanistan anymore. So isn't it fair to conclude from those briefings that the possibility of Al Qaeda or Osama bin Laden obtaining a weapon of mass destruction now is less than it was four weeks ago? And that on that score, the threat is even less than it was before the military campaign began? And viewed in that context, why would the president bring it up? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Because the president wants to make clear that the United States and its allies are going to continue to take every action possible to make certain that they do not acquire any such weapons. And that is one of the reasons that the president has said this campaign must be pursued from a military point of view, to make certain that they never get themselves into a position, as a result of any lack of military action, where they could all of a sudden acquire such weapons. <BR><BR>But you know, what's interesting or what's different about terrorism, as opposed to nation-states, terrorists are able to operate in the shadows. They do things that nation-states, when they do, are more visible, more able to be detected, more easily caught. <BR><BR>Can anybody in the government give you any guarantees that Al Qaeda or any other terrorist nation around the world has not acquired any of the weapons that the president spoke about? There can be no such guarantees. But the United States is going to commit itself to making certain that this mission is complete, from a military point of view, from a diplomatic point of view, working with our allies to receive the intelligence that we are receiving, from nations in the region, from around the world. That is a very helpful way to take every step to make certain that no harm can come to the United States or any other nations. <BR><BR>Question: Someone was in my seat. (Laughter.) Back on your comments about Director [of the CIA George] Tenet and his statements, both of those that you quoted seem to refer to chemical weapons. Are you aware of any public or private conclusions within the United States government that the Al Qaeda was seeking or had already had obtained any radiological material or nuclear weapons? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Actually, the statements referred also to nuclear weapons as well. So—I read quotes that deal with biological and chemical in the case of the training, but the quotes certainly do include nuclear. In fact, one of the quotes: ""Although terrorists we have pre-empted still appear to be relying on conventional weapons, we know that a number of these groups are seeking chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear agents."" That's what Director Tenet said to the Senate. <BR><BR>Question: Ari, is it perhaps that ratcheting up the threat to the level of nuclear weapons in the hands of terrorists is more persuasive to people overseas than the horror of the September 11th attacks, which were visited solely on the United States? Was it the audience, in other words? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Well, no, because when it comes to the audience, of course, it is information that has been talked about domestically previously. I cited earlier this morning some statements that were made by the Director of Central Intelligence, and let me repeat these. <BR><BR><A href=""https://www.cia.gov/news-information/speeches-testimony/2001/UNCLASWWT_02072001.html"">This was made by Director of the CIA George Tenet last year</A>, when Mr. Tenet of course worked in the Clinton administration. And referring to Osama bin Laden, he said—the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency said bin Laden ""has also shown an active interest in chemical weapons. In fact, he has called the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction 'a religious duty.' Last December, bin Laden declared that every American taxpayer is a target."" <BR>Earlier this year—under president—I'm sorry, this was also last year—in testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Director Tenet said, referring to terrorists, ""Among them is bin Laden, who has shown a strong interest in chemical weapons. His operatives have trained to conduct attacks with toxic chemicals or biological toxins."" <BR><BR>So it has been a point of concern for policy makers in open testimony in Congress.

Iraq's biological weapons program remains a serious threat to international security. After signing the BWC [Biological Weapons Convention] in 1972, Iraq developed, produced, and stockpiled biological warfare agents and weapons, and continued this activity even after ratifying the BWC in 1991. Despite the obligation to fully disclose and destroy its BW [biological weapons] program, which the U.N. Security Council required to conclude the Gulf War, Iraq denied having a BW program and pursued a policy of obstruction, denial, and evasion to conceal its program. <BR><BR>Only under increased pressure from UNSCOM [United Nations Special Commission] and the looming defection of one of Iraq's weapons directors did Baghdad admit the existence of its offensive BW program. Baghdad unilaterally ended UNSCOM weapons inspections and monitoring in Iraq in December 1998. Even with unprecedented intrusiveness, UNSCOM, when faced with a nation dedicated to deception and concealment, unfortunately could not fully dismantle Iraq's BW program. Its successor, UNMOVIC [United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission], is prepared to resume on-site activities in Iraq, but Saddam Hussein's continued belligerence prevents it from so doing. The United States strongly suspects that Iraq has taken advantage of three years of no U.N. inspections to improve all phases of its offensive BW program. The existence of Iraq's program is beyond dispute, in complete contravention of the BWC. The BWC Protocol would have neither hindered nor stopped it.""",False,"Biological, Iraq, Al Qaeda",Saddam Hussein,http://www.state.gov/t/us/rm/janjuly/6231.htm,,"SOURCE: John Bolton, undersecretary for arms control and international security, remarks to the fifth Biological Weapons Convention, November 19, 2001.",

What would you say about Iraq, as you begin to look at the next steps in the campaign against global terrorism? What message would you like to send to them now? <BR><BR>The President: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Well, my message is, is that if you harbor a terrorist, you're a terrorist. If you feed a terrorist, you're a terrorist. If you develop weapons of mass destruction that you want to terrorize the world, you'll be held accountable.</SPAN> And I also have said, as I recall at the White House, we're going to make sure that we accomplish each mission that we tackle.

77,2001-11-26,White House Press Briefing by Ari Fleischer,"Question: And to focus on Iraq for a minute, which it seems where the president is focused. He has said now a couple of times over the past few days that Saddam Hussein must allow U.N. inspectors back in to make sure that there is no development of weapons of mass destruction. Is that a hard demand by this administration? Should this be seen as the next phase in the war on terrorism? And what specifically are the consequences for Saddam's— <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Okay. Well, one, I think that the president's focus is on Afghanistan. The president has been focused on phase one, destroying the Al Qaeda and their ability to engage in terrorism; destroying the Taliban and those who harbor terrorists. And in response to some questions the president got about Iraq, he's answered as he did today when he was asked just what you said, what are the consequences. And the president has said, ""that's up for—he'll find out,"" referring to Saddam Hussein. So the president has left it in an undefined way, and I think that's the appropriate place to leave it. <BR><BR>Question: If I could just follow-up. In this question on what ought to be done with Iraq, has the administration essentially settled on an ultimatum, allow weapons inspectors back in or face the consequences? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Terry, that's a reiteration of longstanding American policy that the inspectors need to be allowed back into Iraq. <BR><BR>Question: Is there any additional oomph in it? Is this administration going to put teeth in it? It has been a long time. <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Again, I refer you back to what the president said today in the Rose Garden, and he said that's for him to find out, referring to Iraq's leader, Saddam Hussein. <BR><BR>Question: Will the president try to get other world leaders to get back together and get on a weapons inspection regime in Iraq? In other words, is he going to try to rally the coalition to focus on weapons inspection in Iraq? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: The United Nations has made that plain, that Iraq, as part of their agreement that they entered into after the Gulf War, said they would allow weapons inspectors into Iraq. Iraq unilaterally threw them out, in violation of that agreement. So that's, again, a reiteration of a long-standing American policy. <BR><BR>Question: But, Ari, if I could try one more approach on this. I think the question is whether this is a war aim. I don't think the president has specifically listed this as a war aim in the past, to prevent Iraq from acquiring weapons of mass destruction. Is it now a war aim? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Well, again, let me refer you to the president's words that have sparked the conversation, because I think you have to look at what the president said. And he said, ""If they develop weapons of mass destruction that will be used to terrorize nations, they will be held accountable."" I think you're inferring what that means to unusual lengths. The president said they'll be held accountable. He didn't define what the accountability would mean. Iraq and North Korea have long been listed as nations that sponsor terrorism, and that's what the president said. Saddam Hussein will have to figure it out. <BR><BR>Question: Ari, but the answer to that question came— <BR><BR>Question: But is it a war aim— <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: The president answered the question today by saying, he'll find out. <BR><BR>Major. <BR><BR>Question: His answer came—when I asked him about Iraq specifically, and referred specifically to his words at Fort Campbell, across the world and across the years, he brought up weapons of mass destruction. In his answer to my question about the next phase of the war, he said nations who not only harbor, who give safe haven to terrorists, but also develop weapons of mass destruction. He added that qualifier, weapons of mass destruction, to a specific question about Iraq. It seems to all of us here that that is a new dimension, a new war aim, a shift in policy bringing that definition into a legitimate war target, weapons of mass destruction, where it didn't occur before. <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Well, I can only refer you back to the President's words after the president—toward the very end of the same remarks that you heard, he asked the rhetorical question, have I expanded the definition; ""I've always had that definition, as far as I'm concerned."" <BR><BR>Question: Ari, just one last one on Iraq. When the president left open how we might respond, a lot of us are kind of looking at it as from the military perspective. But is the president trying to lay the groundwork for debate over the sanctions with Iraq? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: No, again, go back to what the president had said previously. I recall him giving a very similar answer when he said, ""That's up for—he'll find out."" The president said something very similar about Iraq during one of the presidential debates—I think it was during the Republican primary in New Hampshire. The president gave almost the exact same answer. <BR><BR>So what you heard today in the Rose Garden about Iraq and North Korea is what you've heard from this president repeatedly, for two years now, from the campaign forward, about the manner in which he would treat Iraq or North Korea, or any nation that's a terrorist sponsor—state sponsor of terrorism, if they were to use, as he put it, use nuclear weapons. There is a long body of quotes from the president prior to November—September 11th, very similar. <BR><BR>Question: But Ari, has he set up some sort of time limit? Because in the <EM>Newsweek</EM> interview, they ask him about Iraq, and he says they should let state inspectors in. And then they come back, and they say, have you set some sort of time limit? And he seems to imply, well, that he has gotten a message to Hussein, there is a time limit. Has he? How did that message get through, and what is that time limit? And then, what's the action if it's not met? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: No, I do not read any implied time limit in that story. It's a longstanding American demand. And it's been something that Iraq agreed to. That was one of the conditions that Iraq agreed to. <BR><BR>Question: Ari, what's behind the decision to use language like, ""he'll find out""? Why be intentionally ambiguous? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: It's a reiteration of something he's been saying for years. <BR><BR>Question: Ari, you and Governor [Tom] Ridge have said repeatedly in the past that there's no evidence linking Iraq to the September 11th attacks or the anthrax attacks. Is that still the case? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: That is correct, Ron. There is nothing that has been brought to my attention by it, so nothing would change that from anything I've heard recently. <BR><BR>Question: Ari, are we making any progress on a new sanctions regime against Iraq? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: The president continues to hold out hope that the sanctions regime against Iraq can be made less porous, that it can be tightened up so that it can be a more focused series of sanctions. That's something that, written, has spoken eloquently about, at the United Nations, and the president remains hopeful that that will one day become the case.",False,"WMD, Al Qaeda, Iraq","Ari Fleischer, George W.

Below is a small segment of the speech. Click on the link to read the forum in its entirety. <BR><BR>James Woolsey: One question that was stated was: Should we use the war against terrorism to get Saddam? To my mind, this is something parallel to asking: Should we, as of December 7, 1941, use the war against fascism to get Hitler? <BR><BR>We have here, for all practical purposes, what is a declared war on the United States, some portions of it silently and some portions of it openly, particularly now, after the bin Laden tape of today, a sort of combination of Hitlers and Torquemadas, who have moved against Western civilization, against civilization period, and against the United States. And there are various facets and aspects of this question. But the first and, I think, most important point is: The way you ask the question is going to determine the answer. <BR><BR>If you ask the question, could we prove beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law that Iraq was behind and directing the attacks of September 11th or the anthrax, then the answer is likely to be no. And if that is your decision criterion, if thats the question you ask, you may decide that you dont think we need to anything with Iraq. <BR><BR>If you ask a different question, is it clearly demonstrable to any reasonable person that Iraq has been substantially engaged in terrorism against the West, and the United States in particular, over the course of the last decade, that there is a reasonable chance that they were involved in September 11th and the anthrax, that they are developing weapons of mass destruction, particularly biological and nuclear in order to terrorize their neighbors, I would submit the answer to that question is a clear yes. And there is probably not much dispute about it. <BR><BR>So the answer you get is going to depend, in part, on the question you ask.

My question is, the United States, maybe Great Britain is backing it, but I see no rush in the Security Council either, in the five corp [sic] groups or 15 or something member group for the inspectors to go back. So is this White House just going to wait for inspectors to come back, or not, or are you going to take other steps? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Well, the president was very clear in what he said. And the reason the president said it is because Saddam Hussein signed an agreement that helped end the Persian Gulf War, in which he committed himself and promised to allow inspectors into the country. That was one of the terms of surrender. And it's another indication of the risks that Saddam Hussein presents to the world—when he made that agreement, swore to the world, and then as soon as he was able to, he reneged on the agreement. <BR><BR>And the president stands strong and firm in his insistence that Saddam Hussein live up to the agreements that he himself made, that he committed his country to, to protect peace and stability in the region. <BR><BR>And the president believes very deeply, having not decided—and I'm not indicating any next course of action specific to Iraq—but that the world follows strong leadership. And I think that's one of the lessons that you've seen in Afghanistan—that the president was strong in Afghanistan and the world has followed; President [Pervez] Musharraf was strong in Pakistan and the Pakistani people have followed.

First, we will shut down terrorist camps, disrupt terrorist plans, and bring terrorists to justice. And, second, we must prevent the terrorists and regimes who seek chemical, biological or nuclear weapons from threatening the United States and the world. <BR><BR>Our military has put the terror training camps of Afghanistan out of business, yet camps still exist in at least a dozen countries. A terrorist underworld—including groups like Hamas, Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad, Jaish-i-Mohammed—operates in remote jungles and deserts, and hides in the centers of large cities. <BR><BR>While the most visible military action is in Afghanistan, America is acting elsewhere. We now have troops in the Philippines, helping to train that country's armed forces to go after terrorist cells that have executed an American, and still hold hostages. <BR><BR>Our soldiers, working with the Bosnian government, seized terrorists who were plotting to bomb our embassy. Our Navy is patrolling the coast of Africa to block the shipment of weapons and the establishment of terrorist camps in Somalia. <BR><BR>My hope is that all nations will heed our call, and eliminate the terrorist parasites who threaten their countries and our own. <BR><BR>Many nations are acting forcefully. Pakistan is now cracking down on terror, and I admire the strong leadership of President [Pervez] Musharraf. <BR><BR>But some governments will be timid in the face of terror. And make no mistake about it: If they do not act, America will. <BR><BR>Our second goal is to prevent regimes that sponsor terror from threatening America or our friends and allies with weapons of mass destruction. Some of these regimes have been pretty quiet since September the 11th. But we know their true nature. <BR><BR>North Korea is a regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction, while starving its citizens. <BR><BR>Iran aggressively pursues these weapons and exports terror, while an unelected few repress the Iranian people's hope for freedom. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Iraq continues to flaunt its hostility toward America and to support terror. The Iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax, and nerve gas, and nuclear weapons for over a decade. This is a regime that has already used poison gas to murder thousands of its own citizens: —leaving the bodies of mothers huddled over their dead children. This is a regime that agreed to international inspections:—then kicked out the inspectors. This is a regime that has something to hide from the civilized world. <BR><BR>States like these, and their terrorist allies, constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world. By seeking weapons of mass destruction, these regimes pose a grave and growing danger. They could provide these arms to terrorists, giving them the means to match their hatred. They could attack our allies or attempt to blackmail the United States. In any of these cases, the price of indifference would be catastrophic.</SPAN> <BR><BR>We will work closely with our coalition to deny terrorists and their state sponsors the materials, technology, and expertise to make and deliver weapons of mass destruction. We will develop and deploy effective missile defenses to protect America and our allies from sudden attack. And all nations should know: America will do what is necessary to ensure our nation's security. <BR><BR>We'll be deliberate, yet time is not on our side. I will not wait on events, while dangers gather. I will not stand by, as peril draws closer and closer.

We've had no serious response from Pyongyang. </P>  <P>Iraq continues to threaten its neighbors, the neighborhood, and its own people, and it continues to flaunt obligations that it undertook in 1991. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>And that can mean only one thing: It remains a dangerous regime, and it remains a regime determined to acquire these terrible weapons.</SPAN> </P>  <P>And Iran. Iran's direct support of regional and global terrorism and its aggressive efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction belie any good intentions it displayed in the days after the world's worst terrorist attacks in history. </P>  <P>All of these nations have a choice to make—to abandon the course they now pursue. Unfortunately, these terrible regimes have shown no inclination to do so. But the United States and the world have only one choice, and that is to act with determination and resolve.</P>  <P>As the president said, we must not and we will not wait on events while dangers gather, and we will use every tool at our disposal to meet this grave global threat. We will work to strengthen nonproliferation regimes and export controls. We will use our new and budding relationship with Russia to redouble our efforts to prevent the leakage of dangerous materials and technologies. And we will move ahead with a missile defense system that can do the job, unconstrained by the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.

On that day we learned, at enormous cost, that the problem goes beyond crime and punishment. The attacks of that day not only demonstrate the failure of previous approaches, they underscore the dangers we will face if we continue living with terrorism. What happened on September 11th, as terrible as it was, is but a pale shadow of what will happen if terrorists use weapons of mass destruction. Our approach has to aim at prevention and not merely punishment. We are at war. Self-defense requires prevention and sometimes pre-emption.

If it's necessary, we can, and we—we—we will if we have to. But it is much better to—to operate within the framework of like-minded nations, and that's the President's policy.

129,2002-02-12,White House Press Briefing by Ari Fleischer,"Question: Is the president ready to go to war with Iraq? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Helen, as the president said in his State of the Union, the president is prepared to take whatever action is necessary to protect the United States, protect our allies, and to protect the peace internationally. And I can assure you that no decisions have been made beyond the first phase of the war on terrorism. The president has been very plainspoken with the American people about the need to fight the war on terrorism wherever terrorism is. And he's focused right now on Afghanistan, but the president has been very clear that time is not on our side because of the threats posed by nations and terrorists against the United States. <BR><BR>Question: Does he know of any connection with the current fight against terrorism by Iraq? Does he have any evidence? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Well, when the president referred to the axis of evil, and identified North Korea, Iran, and Iraq, what the president was referring to is their—not only their support of terrorism, which is plain—they are on the State Department list of terrorist states—but also their development of weapons of mass destruction, their willingness in the case of several of those nations to export technology and material and provide weapons of mass destruction. And the president does fear the marrying of any of these nations with terrorist organizations.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Question: Well, we have weapons of mass destruction, and we don't permit any inspection. <BR><BR>Mr. Fleisher: Helen, if you're suggesting that there's a moral equivalence between the United States' success in keeping the peace for 60 years with our weapons and the actions of terrorists, I would urge you to reexamine that premise. I see no moral equivalence. <BR><BR>Question: Let me ask a question about Iraq. The president's remarks and some other comments by officials after the State of the Union led some people to believe that basically the bombers were warming up and headed to the runway. You and Secretary [Colin] Powell today have suggested that is not the case. What is the case? What is the state of play on going after Iraq? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: First of all, I think that's an over-interpretation. The president said directly in his State of the Union address that we will be patient, we are a deliberative nation, but time is not on our side. And immediately the next morning when I was asked for additional information, I said military action is not imminent. So I think it's all very clear. I think the American people have welcomed what the president said. Let me make a broader point about what the president said, though, on the axis of evil and the language that he used, because this is a type of diplomacy that the president engages in; it's rather plainspoken. The president believes that moral clarity makes for strong diplomacy and that creates better results. And, as an example, Ronald Reagan did not say to Mikhail Gorbachev—let me rephrase that—Ronald Reagan said to Mikhail Gorbachev, tear down this wall. He didn't say, would you mind making it a little shorter? He spoke with moral clarity and, as a result, the world is a better place.

146,2002-02-23,"Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, Interview with the <EM>San Francisco Chronicle</EM>","<P>Robert Collier: On Iraq... regime change. There is some fair amount of debate whether the Iraqi National Congress is a real viable operation or whether it's a farce. What's your take?</P>Wolfowitz: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>There is so much excitement over Iraq, and the president has said some things very, very clearly and I don't want to start embellishing on what he said. What he has said and what I think people need to think a little harder about is that in effect we've got regimes that are open in their hostility towards the United States, that support terrorism and then pursue weapons of mass destruction. That combination of hostile terrorism and weapons of mass destruction is something that is so deadly that you can't afford to wait until you catch them doing it to deal with the problem.</SPAN> I think one way of putting it is that Sept 11 has now given us a very visceral and un-theoretical understanding of what commercial airliners can do and what suicide bombers are capable of. If you've said it back in August you would have been perhaps accused of fantasizing, and now we know what can actually happen. And you can't wait until we have a clear visceral, un-theoretical understanding of what a massive anthrax attack or a radiological or nuclear attack would do to an American city before you work to prevent that form happening. So the countries that pose that connection are a problem. But there's a lot of I think jumping to conclusions that because the president has identified that as a problem that he's also come to a conclusion about what the solution is. Sort of by implication that it is military force, and I don't think he's made any decisions on what to do or suggest that the solution in all three cases is the same. <BR><BR>Collier: But in terms of military analysis, again I'm not asking you to make a diplomatic judgments, but simply in military terms, how feasible are the various options that are a part of public record that have been discussed? The Iraqi National Congress, is it militarily...is the sort of Afghan option open? <BR><BR>Wolfowitz: If I were an academic I might be free to discuss theoretical not military options. But as a fundamental matter we don't start speculating on what military options are available. The fact is though, a lot depends on things that are not military but much more political and the level of political support or opposition that might develop in Iraq in different circumstances and that's somewhat un-knowable. <BR><BR>Collier: What's the relevance of Iraq to 9/11? <BR><BR>Wolfowitz: Go back to what the president said. If you think about what weapons of mass destruction would mean for a future 9/11, not for what happened in September but what could happen next September or in July or whenever, that the lesson of 9/11 is that we probably should have been more active before 9/11 in preventing 9/11. Although if we had gone, if we had attacked, started attacking the Taliban last July people would have said where's the evidence. Is all this just because they blew up our embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam.   <P></P>  <P>I think what we've sort of come to over the last 20 years was, maybe longer, but certainly over the last 20 years was the sort of notion was that terrorism is a necessary evil. It's an evil, but one of those things that you have to live with. You think, in some sense, it was tolerable. I think that what 9/11 has demonstrated is that it is fundamentally intolerable and that is particularly intolerable when it is linked to the possibility of using weapons of mass destruction. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>So you can't wait until you have evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that somebody did something in the past, you know that people are planning to do something against you in the future and that they're developing incredibly destructive weapons to do it with and that's not tolerable.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Collier: Is there any, have you seen any convincing evidence to link Iraq to Al Qaeda or its international network? <BR><BR>Wolfowitz: A lot of this stuff is classified and I really can't get into discussing it. But you know the use of the word evidence there are, I think people shouldn't be under the impression that we have this perfect picture of what's out there and we've got 90–95 percent situational awareness of what Al Qaeda is. If we had, they would have never been able to obviously pull off Sept. 11, and for all that we have been after them since them, and learned a great deal since then. The amount that we don't know is still, I think, much larger than the amount that we do know. The one strength, the only strength, certainly one of the principal strengths of organizations of that kind is the ability to hide and to conceal. That's how they protect against their otherwise enormous weakness. Any time they're found out they can be exposed. So, I think it's a basic principle that has to be understood in addressing this problem. It's one of the reasons why early on Secretary [Donald] Rumsfeld talked about the idea of draining the swamp as opposed to finding out about each individual snake in the swamp and killing it. He wanted, obviously, to the extent you know of things, know of people planning things you go after them. But you also can't be tolerant any longer of people openly providing support for that kind of activity even its not specific, even if you don't know of a specific plan. <BR><BR>Collier: But I'm not asking you to disclose classified information of course, but are you convinced that there are operational links between the Iraqi government and Al Qaeda? <BR><BR>Wolfowitz: I never said there are. <BR><BR>Collier: And so if the to what extent... <BR><BR>Wolfowitz: We also know that there are things that haven't been explained ... like the meeting of Mohammad Atta with Iraqi officials in Prague. It just comes back to the fact that ... <BR><BR>Collier: Which now is alleged right? There is some doubt to that? <BR><BR>Wolfowitz: Now this gets you into classified areas again. I think the point which I do think is fundamental, is that, the premise of your question seems to be, we wait for proof beyond a reasonable doubt. I think the premise of a policy has to be we can't afford to wait for proof beyond a reasonable doubt. That is a way in which any number of terrorist regimes have, over the last 20 years, gotten away with doing things that I think encourage more behavior of that kind. <BR><BR>Collier: Well, Al Qaeda, the war against Al Qaeda of course is large and expanding and complicated. Al Qaeda and its allied international organizations is a huge operation and any major, the concern is, any major offensive against or action dealing with Iraq would both distract U.S. resources in the fight against Al Qaeda and extremely diplomatically complicate the war against Al Qaeda. <BR><BR>Wolfowitz: Look, you're assuming that the president has decided a whole bunch of things that he hasn't decided to do and whether or not he can get the whole world to stand by him. What I'm quite sure of is whatever he decides to do, probably the major objective will remain, how does this support or hurt against this primary terrorist network. I don't know if primary is right word, the one that is our primary target, but not our only target. But, sometimes focus may be the right thing; sometimes a broader campaign may be the right thing. I remember an early stage in the campaign in Afghanistan where people were suggesting that the crucial thing was to separate the Al Qaeda from the Taliban and not to attack the Taliban but to only attack Al Qaeda. I think in retrospect that was totally impracticable advice and to the contrary what turned out when the Taliban fell was all kinds of governments that had bad records in this area suddenly started getting very cooperative with us. So, I think anything we do has got to be evaluated against standards of this broad campaign and I think it will be evaluated in that way. I would just sort of caution people to not assume before the president decided what to do that he has decided what to do. I think it is perfectly appropriate to ask the question if we do something with any of those three countries that he mentions how will that affect our ability to get cooperation against other targets, and in particular against Al Qaeda. It's, I'm sure, going to be one of the principal considerations. <BR><BR>Let me give you another example. I've heard it said that it was terribly beastly of him to say unkind things about the Iranians and that all this has done is drive the moderates into the hands of the hard-liners. But one of the first things that came after the state of the union message was that the Iranians were detaining, I think that they're claim was 140 Al Qaeda people who had passed through Iran. Now I don't know whether they are actually detaining any of those folks, but it certainly seems to me that their reaction to the president's message was to start to do the right thing. <BR><BR>You make a move in this campaign and you get certain reactions from it and from those reactions you can decide on what your next steps will be. But what the president has said from the beginning, and I think its absolutely right, is that you can't focus, it certainly would have been a mistake to just focus on Iran, it would be a mistake to just focus on one particular terrorist network. There is an opportunity now to really move to a policy that doesn't continue tolerate terrorism as a necessary evil. And I think in that respect that 9/11 really was a wake up call and that if we take proper advantage of this opportunity to prevent the future terrorist use of weapons of mass destruction that it will have been an extremely valuable wake up call. But if we say our only problem was to respond to 9/11, and we wait until somebody hits us with nuclear weapons before we take that kind of threat seriously, we will have made a very big mistake. </P>",True,"Axis of Evil, Al Qaeda, chemical, biological, nuclear, WMD, Iraq, FS","George W.

A report in <EM>The Washington Post</EM> this morning that we have depleted our smart bomb supply to the point that we have stretched the National Guard and the regular forces to the point that if the United States decided in some way to go after Saddam Hussein and go into Iraq that we couldn't do that for a year; that we're just simply not—we're not—we don't have the capability to do that right now. I'd like to hear your response to that. <BR><BR>Secretary Rumsfeld: Well, first, let me just set the subject of Iraq off to the side and—and not address it. It seems to me there's so much talk about Iraq and North Korea and Iran as a result of the president's speech, and what he was attempting to do and, I think, did very effectively was to focus world opinion on those countries and how they treat their people and how they treat their neighbors and the dangers they pose from a standpoint of weapons of mass destruction. I think it was a very useful thing to do. <BR><BR>Full stop, go to the question of munitions. We've expended a great many of the so-called smart weapons, bombs, in Afghanistan. We are rapidly replenishing them. This happens at any time one's engaged. And you can be sure that the United States of America is—is going to be capable of doing anything that the president asks them to do because he'll know that before he asks anyone to do anything. <BR><BR>Schieffer: But how important is it this whole business of Saddam? Are we pressing now, as strongly as we can, and how important is it for the United States and—and for the allies to be able to go in and inspect and know whether or not he is... <BR><BR>Secretary Rumsfeld: Yeah. <BR><BR>Schieffer: . . . producing weapons of mass destruction? Somebody said this morning that we want 24-hour—we want to guarantee of being able to go in there at any hour of the day or night to see what he's doing. Is that what we're after here? <BR><BR>Secretary Rumsfeld: Well, if you think about it, go back to when we did have inspectors in there, which is years ago. When they were there, they had an enormously difficult time finding anything. Under the rules and restrictions that were imposed on them by Iraq, the only real information they got was not by scooping around on the ground finding things and discovering things, because they were able to move them, hide them underground, lie about them, not allow them to go in, wait long periods before they could go in. The only real information that they found was from defectors—got away from Saddam Hussein, got out of the country, told the inspectors where to look, which they then did, and they then found some things. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Now what's happened in the intervening period? Well, technology's evolved. The Iraqis have had more time to go underground. They've had lots of dual use technologies that's come in. They've had lots of illicit things that have come in. They have advanced their weapons of mass destruction programs. They've developed greater degrees of mobility. They—they are very accomplished liars as—as to what's going on. It would be—you could put inspectors all over that place and it would be very difficult to find anything.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Gloria Borger: So are you saying that weapons inspections would be worthless? <BR><BR>Secretary Rumsfeld: No, I am say that if one thought that the old regime was successful, they're mistaken. The old regime was successful in part because of defectors telling them what to look for, not because they actually found something. And I'm saying today the situation's vastly more difficult. Therefore, you—if you try to use the old regime, it wouldn't work. You'd have to have a much more intrusive regime and many more inspectors and th—the Iraqis not controlling when they could come in, where they could go, what they could do. And the Iraqis aren't going to agree to something like that. <BR><BR>Schieffer: Well, I—I just—I'm not sure I understand what you're—are you saying it's more important than ever for us to be able to go in there and inspect, or are you saying that maybe it doesn't make that much difference? I'm—I'm just not clear on... <BR><BR>Secretary Rumsfeld: I'm saying that in—in—under the best of circumstances, inspectors have a very, very difficult time, because you're dealing with a regime that is repressive, that kills people, their own people, frequently, that lies in very skillful ways, that's had years to take advanced technology, go underground, hide things, deny things, create mobility where they can actually keep them moving ahead of any inspector, and it would—it's just very difficult to do. We—you—you're quite right, it's enormously important that we have knowledge about what he's doing. He has shown that he's willing to use weapons of mass destruction on his own people.

If you don't get that, down the road you decide you want to take action, would you take action against Iraq unilaterally? <BR><BR>The President: One of the things I've said to our friends is that we will consult, that we will share our views of how to make the world more safe. In regards to Iraq, we're doing just that. Every world leader that comes to see me, I explain our concerns about a nation which is not conforming to agreements that it made in the past; a nation which has gassed her people in the past; <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>a nation which has weapons of mass destruction and apparently is not afraid to use them.</SPAN> <BR><BR>And so one of the—what the Vice President is doing is he's reminding people about this danger, and that we need to work in concert to confront this danger. Again, all options are on the table, and—but one thing I will not allow is a nation such as Iraq to threaten our very future by developing weapons of mass destruction. They've agreed not to have those weapons; they ought to conform to their agreement, comply with their agreement. Yes, John. <BR><BR>Question: It seems to me—you seem to be saying, yes, you would consult with the allies and others, including in the Mideast, but if you had to, you'd go ahead and take action yourself. <BR><BR>The President: Well, you're answering the question for me. If I can remember the exact words, I'll say it exactly the way I said it before. We are going to consult. I am deeply concerned about Iraq. And so should the American people be concerned about Iraq. And so should people who love freedom be concerned about Iraq. <BR><BR>This is a nation run by a man who is willing to kill his own people by using chemical weapons; a man who won't let inspectors into the country; a man who's obviously got something to hide.

But we're concerned about the Middle East, John, because it's affecting the lives of the Palestinians and our friends, the Israelis. I mean, it's a terrible period of time, when a lot of people are losing their lives, needlessly losing life. And terrorists are holding a potential peace process hostage. And so while I understand the linkage, for us the policy stands on its own. The need for us to involved in the Middle East is to help save lives. And we're going to stay involved in the Middle East, and, at the same time, continue to talk about Iraq and Iran and other nations, and continue to wage a war on terror, which is exactly what we're doing. <BR><BR>I want to reiterate what I said the other day.

The on-going U.N. sanctions and U.S. military presence continue to be the keys to restraining Saddam's ambitions. Indeed, years of U.N. sanctions, embargoes, and inspections, combined with U.S. and Coalition military actions, have significantly degraded Iraq's military capabilities. Saddam's military forces are much smaller and weaker than those he had in 1991. Manpower and equipment shortages, a problematic logistics system, and fragile military morale remain major shortcomings. Saddam's paranoia and lack of trust—and related oppression and mistreatment—extend to the military, and are a drain on military effectiveness. <BR><BR>Nevertheless, Iraq's ground forces continue to be one of the most formidable within the region. They can move rapidly and pose a threat to Iraq's neighbors. Baghdad's air and air defense forces retain only a marginal defensive capability. The Air Force cannot effectively project air power outside Iraq's borders. Still, Saddam continues to threaten Coalition forces in the No-Fly Zones, and remains committed to interfering with Coalition military operations monitoring his military activities. </P>  <P>Iraq retains a residual level of WMD [weapons of mass destruction] and missile capabilities. The lack of intrusive inspection and disarmament mechanisms permits Baghdad to enhance these programs. Iraq probably retains limited numbers of SCUD-variant missiles, launchers, and warheads capable of delivering biological and chemical agents. Baghdad continues work on short-range (150 km) liquid and solid propellant missiles allowed by UNSCR [United Nations Security Council Resolution] 687 and can use this expertise for future long-range missile development. Iraq may also have begun to reconstitute chemical and biological weapons programs. </P>  <P>Despite the damage done to Iraq's missile infrastructure during the Gulf War and Operation Desert Fox, Iraq may have ambitions for longer-range missiles, including an ICBM [intercontinental ballistic missile]. Depending on the success of acquisition efforts and the degree of foreign support, it is possible that Iraq could develop and test an ICBM capable of reaching the U.S. by 2015. <BR><BR>Saddam's regime will continue to pose political and military challenges to Coalition interests. Should sanctions be removed formally or become ineffective, Iraq will move quickly to expand its WMD and missile capabilities, develop a more capable strategic air defense system, and improve other conventional force capabilities. Saddam is intent on acquiring a large inventory of WMD and modernizing and expanding his fleet of tanks, combat aircraft, and artillery guns. While Iraq would still have to grapple with shortcomings in training and military leadership, such a modernized and expanded force would allow Saddam to increasingly threaten regional stability and ultimately, the global economy. </P>",False,"chemical, biological, nuclear, WMD, Iraq",Saddam Hussein,http://www.shaps.hawaii.edu/security/us/wilson_2002.html,,"SOURCE: Thomas Wilson, for-the-record statement to the Senate Armed Services Committee, March 19, 2002.",

Has the violence in the Middle East thwarted your efforts? And Prime Minister [Tony] Blair, has Bush convinced you on the need for military action against Iraq? <BR><BR>The President: Adam, the prime minister and I, of course, talked about Iraq. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>We both recognize the danger of a man who's willing to kill his own people harboring and developing weapons of mass destruction.</SPAN> This guy, Saddam Hussein, is a leader who gasses his own people, goes after people in his own neighborhood with weapons of—chemical weapons. He's a man who obviously has something to hide. He told the world that he would show us that he would not develop weapons of mass destruction and yet, over the past decade, he has refused to do so. And the prime minister and I both agree that he needs to prove that he isn't developing weapons of mass destruction. <BR><BR>I explained to the prime minister that the policy of my government is the removal of Saddam and that all options are on the table. <BR><BR>The Prime Minister: I can say that any sensible person looking at the position of Saddam Hussein and asking the question, would the region, the world and not least the ordinary Iraqi people be better off without the regime of Saddam Hussein? The only answer anyone could give to that question would be yes. Now, how we approach this, this is a matter for discussion. This is a matter for considering all the options. But a situation where he continues to be in breach of all the United Nations resolutions, refusing to allow us to assess, as the international community have demanded, whether and how he is developing these weapons of mass destruction. Doing nothing in those circumstances is not an option. So we consider all the options available. But the president is right to draw attention to the threat of weapons of mass destruction. That threat is real. How we deal with it, that's a matter we discuss. But that the threat exists and we have to deal with it, that seems to me a matter of plain common sense. <BR><BR>Question: Prime minister, we've heard the president say what his policy is, directly, about Saddam Hussein, which is to remove him, that is the policy of the American administration. Could I ask you whether that is now the policy of the British government? And could I ask you both if it is now your policy to target Saddam Hussein, what has happened to the doctrine of not targeting heads of state and leaving countries to decide who their leaders should be, which is one of the principles which applied during the Gulf war? <BR><BR>The Prime Minister: Well, John, you know, it has always been our policy that Iraq would be a better place without Saddam Hussein. I don't think anyone could be in any doubt about that for all the reasons I gave earlier. And reasons to do with weapons of mass destruction also do with the appalling brutality and repression of his own people. But how we now proceed in this situation, how we make sure that this threat that is posed by weapons of mass destruction is dealt with, that is a matter that is open. And when the time comes for taking those decisions we will tell people about those decisions. But you cannot have a situation in which he carries on being in breach of the U.N. resolutions and refusing to allow us the capability of assessing how that weapons-of-mass-destruction capability is being advanced, even though the international community has made it absolutely clear that he should do so. Now as I say, how we then proceed from there, that is a matter that is open for us. <BR><BR>The President: Maybe I should be a little less direct and a little more nuanced and say we support regime change. <BR><BR>Question: That's a change though, isn't it, a change in policy? <BR><BR>The President: No, it's really not. Regime change was the policy of my predecessor as well. <BR><BR>Question: And your father? <BR><BR>The President: You know, I can't remember that far back. (Laughter.)

Ron, as the president has said, throughout the summer, beginning in May, the president received, as I indicated, reporting on threats and intelligence hits throughout the summer, mainly focused on overseas. In August, the president, as you know, was at his ranch in Crawford. As part of his morning daily intelligence briefing from the CIA, he received that generalized information that I've talked about, vis-a-vis hijacking. <BR><BR>Question: Wasn't [CIA Director George] Tenet— <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: No, the director did not personally deliver that briefing. <BR><BR>Question: What date? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: It was early August. <BR><BR>Question: So before the arrest of Zacharias Moussaoui? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Early August. I know it was the first week of August. Ron, did you have anything else? <BR><BR>Question: If you can get us the exact day. And then what happened with that threat? What agent—what law enforcement or federal agencies were told about it, and what did they do in response? <BR><BR>Question: And the threats—just for clarification—were related to Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden, right? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Throughout the summer, they received numerous threat warnings, as I indicated. In fact, as the president—let me cite you the president's words, as he described the information that was available to him. This was what the president himself said on December 20th, 2001, to <EM>The Washington Post</EM> in an interview he gave them. ""We also had been getting some intelligence hits throughout the summer—mainly focused overseas, by the way—and there had been a series of responses that we took to harden embassies. But it was clear that bin Laden felt emboldened and didn't feel threatened by the United States."" <BR><BR>As a result of the information that came in beginning in that May period and throughout the summer, embassies were hardened throughout the world, military installations went through their normal procedures to harden against potential terrorist attacks. Those are a series of concrete actions that are taken by the embassies and by installations. Domestically, through normal security channels, the Department of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration were made aware of general information that, while mentioning hijackings, did not include specific and detailed warnings. This information, as with all sensitive security information, was passed on to the carriers through a series of briefings and notifications. It is important to note that this was nonspecific threat that mentioned hijacking. <BR><BR>Question: Well, I'm confused. Is that in response to the information that started coming on May 5th, or in response to the briefing he got the first week of August? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: As I indicated this morning, keep in mind exactly the process of how information flows to the president when it comes to these type of briefings. When the information comes to the president, it's because the agencies have developed in a period of time prior to the briefing.

We can expect other new techniques of terrorism. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>The problem I see—and it's a very serious one—is that there has been a proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. And the terrorist networks have close linkages with terrorist states, the states that are on the worldwide known terrorist list—Iraq, Iran, Libya, Syria, North Korea, one or two others. Now, those countries have been developing weapons of mass destruction for some time. They are testing and weaponize chemical and biological weapons. They are aggressively trying to get nuclear weapons.</SPAN> We know that. And I guess the second part of the question you posed as to the magnitude is I think realistically we have to face up to the fact that we live in a world where our margin for error has become quite small. In just facing the facts, we have to recognize that terrorist networks have relationships with terrorist states that have weapons of mass destruction, and that they inevitably are going to get their hands on them, and they would not hesitate one minute in using them.

We have to recognize that the word surprise—the only thing we ought to be surprised about is that we are surprised when we are surprised. If a terrorist can attack at any time at any place using any technique, that advantage is there. The Al Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan train hundreds of these people. They are spread across the globe. They are in our country, and they are very well-trained. We have seen their training manuals. And they are well-financed. They are still getting money.

I know what's taken place since the attacks on September the 11th. Our communications between the two agencies is much better than ever before. We've got a much better—doing a much better job of sharing intelligence. <BR><BR>I, of course, want the Congress to take a look at what took place prior to September the 11th.

He's a dangerous man. He's a dictator who gassed his own people. He's had a history of incredible human-rights violations. And he is a—it's dangerous to think of a scenario in which a country like Iraq would team up with an Al Qaeda-type organization, particularly if and when they have the capacity, had the capacity, or when they have the capacity to deliver weapons of mass destruction via ballistic missile. And that's a threat. It's a threat to Germany, it's a threat to America, it's a threat to civilization itself. And we've got to deal with it. We can play like it's not there, we can hope it goes away. But that's not going to work.

The Joint Chiefs of Staff have waged a determined behind-the-scenes campaign to persuade the Bush administration to reconsider an aggressive posture toward Iraq in which war was regarded as all but inevitable. This included a secret briefing at the White House earlier this month for President Bush by Army General Tommy R. Franks, who as head of the Central Command would oversee any U.S. military campaign against Iraq. During the meeting, Franks told the president that invading Iraq to oust Saddam Hussein would require at least 200,000 troops, far more than some other military experts have calculated. This was in line with views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who have repeatedly emphasized the lengthy buildup that would be required, concerns about Hussein's possible use of biological and chemical weapons, and the possible casualties, officials said. The Bush administration still appears dedicated to the goal of removing the Iraqi leader from power, but partly in response to the military's advice, it is focusing more on undermining him through covert intelligence operations, two officials added.

This as American soldiers remain at stake as they fight for freedom in nearby Afghanistan. But will the war on terror soon include Iraq? It has been the focus of a lot of talk in Washington and around the globe. For the very latest, I talked to Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz. </P>  <P>There has been a lot of talk about what to do and maybe what not to do with Iraq. We are hearing that there is a lot of conflicting opinions, that the president and the defense secretary are getting a lot of different opinions. What are you hearing? <BR><BR>Wolfowitz: Well, the most important thing is what the whole country heard on January 29th in the State of the Union message where the president laid out the basic problems we face as a country, which is there are countries, <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>and Iraq is one of them, that are hostile to us, that support terrorists, and that have chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons and are working to develop more of them.</SPAN> And that is a real danger. It could create a disaster that would make September 11 look like something rather small. And we have got to do something about that problem, we can't continue living with it forever. <BR><BR>Cosby: How close do you think they are to developing weapons of mass destruction if they are not stopped? <BR><BR>Wolfowitz: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Oh, I think the Iraqis have some already and there was not much doubt about that when the U.N. inspectors were kicked out four or five years ago. They are working on more, and the longer we wait the longer it takes, the more such weapons they'll have.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Cosby: In your assessment, when do you think we would need to take some sort of action? <BR><BR>Wolfowitz: Well, you can't give precise timetables. And ultimately these are major decisions for the president himself to decide. You have got to weigh all the different factors that go into what can contribute to success, what are the costs of delay. But it is a serious problem. <BR><BR>Cosby: In your assessment, is it something that needs to be taken care of by the end of the year or the beginning of next year?<BR><BR>Wolfowitz: I can't put timetables on it. <BR><BR>Cosby: We've heard all these different reports. <BR><BR>Wolfowitz: Yeah, and you'll keep hearing all these different reports. Maybe a little confusion is a little helpful in this subject. </P>  <P>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Cosby: Are there any suggestions—you're someone who has kept a close eye on Iraq and considered very much an expert in this area. What do you see as sort of the most threatening aspects and also the best ways to go into that country, to go in after Saddam Hussein? <BR><BR>Wolfowitz: I'll just go over the same ground again. I mean, the problem with Iraq is what the president stated. It is a very clear problem, and there is no question that the solution is a change of regime in Iraq. And we have been very clear about that. I think if you could ever take a free vote of the 25 million or so Iraqi people, you get somewhere well in the 90s, high 90 percentiles agreeing with that view. How we get there involves very crucial decisions that really only the president of the United States can decide. <BR><BR>Cosby: Is there anything that Iraq could do at this point that could change anything? And let's talk about weapons inspectors: If they were to allow weapons inspectors back in would that change anything at this point? <BR><BR>Wolfowitz: The problem is very fundamental. Five years ago, four or five years ago when Saddam Hussein stopped the inspectors and then kicked them out, we had quite amazing sources of intelligence. His son-in-law had recently defected and gave us all kinds of new leads for his programs. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>And in the years intervening, he has no doubt had time to hide things in places that would be very hard to look. So he has made it very, very difficult to ever convince the world that he has done what he was supposed to have done 11 years ago, which was to get rid of these things. And it is very clear that he hasn't gotten rid of them.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Cosby: I know you can't give me specifics on time frame, but you believe even in the next decade per se we would see a change of regime for sure in Iraq influenced by the United States and other countries? <BR><BR>Wolfowitz: We're not talking about imposing things. I mean, let's come back to the nature of that regime. It is a regime that governs its own people by fear and terror. And as I said, I don't think there is any question that if the Iraqi people are given a free choice, there will be a change of regime. And we would like to facilitate that free choice by whatever means. I would not rule out that it might be done without the use of military force. <BR><BR>Cosby: What about Iran, because there has been a lot of talk this week, and topping the terror lists that the administration released, do you see Iraq as the biggest threat or do you see Iran? <BR><BR>Wolfowitz: We don't measure things that way. Iran is a very different kind of country. It is about twice the size, for one thing. It is bigger and different. But one of the important things that took place in Iran a couple of years ago was they allowed an election. It wasn't a completely free election, but it was a lot freer than the hard-liners there probably wished they had allowed. And the result is that some 75 percent of the Iranian people voted for a change of government. Well, they got their candidate in as president, but they really didn't get a change of government. The security forces, the instruments of terror and coercion in that country, are still held by the minority that got at best 25 percent of the vote. So when you think about Iran, you think about how to get Iran out of the business of supporting terrorism and developing weapons of mass destruction, one of the things you have to think about is how to leverage that already quite open opposition to the regime that was even expressed in the form of a vote. </P>",True,"chemical, biological, nuclear, WMD, Iraq, FS","Paul Wolfowitz, Saddam Hussein, George W.

There were cases where 500 people surrounded to a corporal, one corporal. Over the four-day, five-day period, the whole thing, there were something like, I don't know whether it's 40,000, 50,000, 60,000 people—80,000 people who surrendered. I just can't conceive of people living in a regime that's that repressive and thinking that they'd like it to go on. So you have to assume some people will surrender. Will they rise up, which is I think the phrase you used? I think that's not likely. I think that people who rise up get killed. Think, what was it, Hungary or Czechoslovakia where there was, in '56—Hungary, where there was a feeling that the West might do something, and they rose up and hundreds of hundreds of people were killed. <BR><BR><EM>Washington Post</EM>: People were throwing dinner plates at tanks. But I ask the question because it seems to be central to the planning and strategy of those who think an invasion of Iraq would be a cakewalk. <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: Nothing's a cakewalk and everything's unpredictable and life's hard.

233,2002-06-10,"Defense Secretary&nbsp;Donald Rumsfeld, Press Briefing at Kuwait City International Airport","<P>Rumsfeld: In my meetings, we had good discussions about the way ahead with respect to the global war on terrorism. We discussed the stability in the Gulf region and certainly, the continuing violations of U.N. resolutions by Iraq. But I am very pleased to be here and to have had this chance to discuss so many matters of mutual interest, and I would be happy to respond to questions. <BR><BR>Question: What do you make of the statement made by the Iraqi government yesterday that Iraq has no weapons of mass destruction and is not developing any? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>They are lying. Next.</SPAN> </P>  <P>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Question: Did you get commitments from Kuwait that they would take part in any new effort to contain Iraq if it comes to military might? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: I wouldn't put it that way. Kuwait has been obviously very cooperative in all aspects of supporting the U.N. resolutions and the world community's effort to see that Iraq does not develop weapons of mass destruction, and that it does not entertain acts of aggression against its neighbors. We had a variety of discussions along that line. </P>  <P>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Question: A lot of people in this country say that they're tired of the Iraqi threats toward their country. Would it mean any military might in the near future that will end up in toppling the regime in Iraq, and would you increase your troops in the region? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: The United States government, for a number of years now, has believed that the solution in Iraq would be regime change. That is to say that their current regime has, by its behavior, its repression of its own people, by its invasion of Kuwait, by its development of weapons of mass destruction, by its continued violations of the no-fly zones, by its unwillingness to release prisoners from Kuwait, by its unwillingness to return archives and records that were stolen, by a whole host of acts and indications of behavior that are harmful to the region. </P>  <P>So the U.S. policy favoring regime change is something that for a number of years has been the policy and the conviction of successive governments in our country. Towards that end, obviously, we have been participating with coalition forces in attempting to enforce the no-fly zone. We have been working with Kuwait and other countries, with respect to other aspects of the U.N. resolutions, sanctions and so forth. What might take place prospectively is not something that is for me to be talking about. But clearly, if you want the policy of our country, it is that the regime of Saddam Hussein is a destabilizing factor of the region. <BR><BR>Question: When you say that Iraq is lying. That story mentioned having weapons— <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: Sometimes I understate for emphasis. <BR><BR>Question: I don't think I missed the point. But it was a two part thing, that were not developing and that they did not have any. Were they lying about one, or both? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>No. They have them and they continue to develop them and they have weaponized chemical weapons, we know that. They've had an active program to develop nuclear weapons. It's also clear that they are actively developing biological weapons. I don't know what other kinds of weapons would fall under the rubric of weapons of mass destruction, but if there are more, I suspect they're working on them as well, even though I don't happen to know what they are. It is just false, not true, inaccurate and typical.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Question: During your tenure do you expect to see regime change in Iraq? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: Oh, I would certainly hope so. I would think most of the people in the region and in the world recognize that the world would be a better place without that regime.

This is what you said in Kuwait—you said you are against Iraq and Kuwait working together. <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: No, I didn't. Let me tell you what I did say, or as close as I can remember. </P>  <P><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>I was asked a question about Iraq announcing the day before that they do not have weapons of mass destruction, and they asked me what I thought about that. I said ""That's a lie,"" and I may have said even that. ""That's a world-class lie."" </P>  <P>Now that's true; it is a lie. They do have weapons of mass destruction. They've used chemical weapons on their people, they have had an aggressive program to develop nuclear weapons, and there is no question that they are developing biological weapons. </P>  <P>Now why did I say that? I said that because it is true. The truth has a certain virtue, it seems to me. What I said didn't raise tensions, what raises tensions in the region is Saddam Hussein developing weapons of mass destruction and threatening neighbors.</SPAN> </P>  <P>Now to go to the second part of your question. Yes, I was asked what I thought about the proposals or ideas that had been floated between Iraq and another country, or other countries in the region, and I said that you have to simply look at Iraq and look at the number of times they have lied, and look at the invasion of Kuwait and look at the threats they make to their other neighbors about the illegitimacy about their regimes. Now, at the present time I suspect Iraq is trying to talk softly and be less aggressive because of the pressure of the U.N. on inspectors. But I think that their history is such that I think that relying on it would be quite risky—relying on their soft, gentle side that they're putting forward would be quite risky. <BR><BR>Question: Mr. Secretary, given the efforts that you are undertaking to gather support for toppling Saddam Hussein, can we assume—<BR><BR>Rumsfeld: Wait a second, when you began that question by making an assertion as to what I am doing, I think it's unfortunate, because then it causes me to have to untangle an inaccurate assertion before I can even begin answering your question.

Is it true, as we feel, that the purpose of your visit is to gather support to topple Saddam Hussein's regime? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: That's not true. <BR><BR>Question: No? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: No. I am here. I have been Secretary of Defense of the U.S. since January 2001. We have very close relationships in this region, and I am apologetic, but I have not been able to get here earlier than that. I hoped to come last year. We have broad military-to-military relations, and political relationships, and economic relationships.

Top figures from both parties welcomed the presidential order, reported yesterday in <EM>The Washington Post</EM>, which informed sources said gives the CIA authority to use lethal force in capturing Hussein.

The document envisions tens of thousands of marines and soldiers probably invading from Kuwait. Hundreds of warplanes based in as many as eight countries, possibly including Turkey and Qatar, would unleash a huge air assault against thousands of targets, including airfields, roadways, and fiber-optics communications sites. Special operations forces or covert CIA operatives would strike at depots or laboratories storing or manufacturing Iraq's suspected weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to launch them.

Yet the concept for such a plan is now highly evolved and is apparently working its way through military channels. Once a consensus is reached on the concept, the steps toward assembling a final war plan and, most importantly, the element of timing for ground deployments and commencement of an air war, represent the final sequencing that Mr. Bush will have to decide.

253,2002-07-11,Planners Raise Bar for Iraqi Invasion,"<P>A full-scale U.S. invasion of Iraq will require significant provocation by Saddam Hussein's regime—such as invading a neighbor, fielding a nuclear weapon or attacking its minority population, top Bush administration officials have concluded. Senior officials at the Pentagon, State Department, and other agencies say President Bush's national security team has agreed that the most dramatic option for toppling Saddam—a large-scale invasion—would be politically difficult at home and abroad without justification beyond Iraq's current friction with Washington over the suspected development of weapons of mass destruction.

254,2002-07-12,U.S. War Planners Waiting for Iraq To Cross the Line,"The Bush administration appears to be almost hoping that Iraq will take some step that would qualify as cause for an attack by U.S. forces. President Bush's national security team is tracking four key areas to look for evidence that Iraq has crossed a line that would represent justification for a major military action against Saddam Hussein's regime. Lesser tactics, such as covert operations or support for internal rebellion, could go forward at any time without further provocation, the officials have agreed. Iraq's current activities in each of these areas, which involve weapons of mass destruction and terrorism, represent a potentially serious threat to U.S. national security. But at the moment, senior Bush advisers believe that none quite rises to the level that would justify an invasion, according to U.S. officials familiar with military planning on Iraq. <BR><BR>—The CIA says Iraq is seeking to develop a nuclear weapon but is probably years from succeeding because of the difficulty of producing the necessary fissile material, especially under the international embargo on Iraq. The timetable could shorten if Iraq obtained plutonium or enriched uranium on the international black market. <BR><BR>—The CIA says Iraq is reconstituting its ability to develop chemical and biological weapons, though U.S. intelligence is less clear on whether Iraq has these weapons ready to use. <BR><BR>—Iraq continues to defy international weapons inspections, most recently in negotiations last week with top U.N. officials. Iraq says it will allow no further inspections, which it agreed to at the end of the 1991 Persian Gulf War, unless the United Nations lifts all sanctions on Iraq. <BR><BR>—Iraq is on the list of terrorist-sponsoring nations, and the CIA says Iraq actively supports a variety of terror groups. But the agency has yet to establish a clear link between Iraq and Al Qaeda, the militant Islamic group believed responsible for the September 11 terrorist attacks. Though the agency is pursuing leads pointing to some tenuous links between Iraq and Al Qaeda, it has no evidence tying Saddam's regime to the September 11 attacks. <BR><BR>The approach the Bush administration is taking on Iraq differs markedly from the one the elder President Bush adopted a dozen years ago. In the weeks before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, Secretary of State James Baker adopted no firm position on a simmering dispute between Iraq and Kuwait. Saddam took Washington's apparent neutral stance as a sign it could invade with impunity. The lesson from that episode was that giving Iraq a clear ""line in the sand"" could prevent war. This time, the younger Bush's administration says there is no point in trying to modify Iraqi behavior. The administration's policy is to oust the regime, by military force or other means. <BR><BR>So an offense by Iraq is not a crisis to be avoided but an opportunity to be exploited. The problem for the administration: The current dispute over U.N. inspections falls short of what officials say Bush needs to win domestic and international support for a full-scale military attack on Iraq.",False,"chemical, biological, nuclear, WMD, Al Qaeda, Iraq","George W.

259,2002-07-15,"Defense Secretary&nbsp;Donald Rumsfeld, Interview with CNBC","<P>Brian Williams: Every major American newspaper and newscast has had details of various war plans in Iraq that are in front of this president, or near this president, that he will be looking at. Why telegraph U.S. options militarily on the ground in Iraq? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: Well, first of all, we're not telegraphing U.S. options on the ground. The United States government is not. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>The president has properly pointed out the repressiveness of that regime, and the fact that that regime is developing weapons of mass destruction that pose a real threat to the people of Iraq, to the people that live in the region, as well as to the people across the globe. This is a very dangerous regime.</SPAN> The president said that. </P>  <P>We have always had war plans and contingency plans and operation plans in this building. We had them 25 years ago, when I was secretary of defense, and we have them today. I've recently issued contingency guidance that has required that we review all of those plans, and there are dozens of them, for a whole host of both combatant contingencies, as well as non-combatant contingencies, such as evacuations, and that type of thing. We're reviewing all of them, and updating them. And we're elevating the risks, so that they can be judged, and they can be brought up to an appropriate level of potential value. <BR><BR>Every once in a while, there are people in the United States government who decide that they want to break federal criminal law, and release classified information, and they ought to be imprisoned. And if we find out who they are, they will be imprisoned. It is putting peoples' lives at risk. It is making more difficult the task of finding terrorists across the globe. It is a serious violation of federal criminal law. Why people do it, I do not know. They obviously want to make themselves look important, and they have favorite reporters and press people that they think they can curry favor with. And they go to them, and hand them things that ought not to be given to the public, and those—they then appear in a public press. <BR><BR>It happens that the piece that you're referring to, that was on the front page of <EM>The New York Times</EM>, is not something that was at a high level. It was apparently something—we do—we don't know what it is. I've never seen it; General [Tommy] Franks has never seen it. Goodness knows, the president's never seen it. It was something that was done down at a lower level, either at somebody's request, or not at somebody's request, and it has no official blessing by anybody up at any reasonable level in the government of the United States. But nonetheless, it obviously goes out, and it represents what somebody who advises somebody at a lower level, thought was a good idea. So, they took that piece of paper, and gave it to a reporter. <BR><BR>I would dearly like to find them. I think that people who know who those people are would do the country a service if they'd let me know who those people are. And I'd like to see them behind bars. <BR><BR>Williams: You seem quite angered by this particular leak, even though the president, at some point, will have to let the American people in on American plans in Iraq. <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: Wrong, you do not let anybody in on war plans. <BR><BR>Williams: If you're committing a Desert Storm, Part Two? At some point—&nbsp;<BR><BR>Rumsfeld: If you have plans as to how one is going to conduct an operation, you do not let anybody know what those are, because the enemy knows what they are. The enemy is then able to take steps that will cause greater loss of life on the part of Americans, and coalition forces, and clearly, make more difficult the accomplishment of the task. <BR><BR>Williams: Let me come at it this way. Saddam Hussein is in power, despite an American war against him. It is widely said that, even with 2—, 300—, 400,000 American troops, and all the technology this country has to bring to bear in that region, it will take, as an assist, an uprising from within to help to topple that regime, a stated and sworn enemy of the United States. Do you think the dissension is there inside Iraq? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: Well, you never know. I think that to go back to Desert Storm, it's instructive that hundreds of Iraqi military people surrendered to privates and corporals in the United States Army; that tens of thousands, 70—, 80,000 troops surrendered, within a matter of days. The regime of Saddam Hussein is so vicious, and killed so many of their own people, and used chemical weapons against their own people, and denies those people opportunities—the ability to travel, the ability to speak out. It is a—one of the most vicious regimes on the face of the earth. <BR><BR>Now, people that live in a regime like that don't like it. It is not the kind of thing that you can overthrow readily, but because it's so vicious, and there's so many people in prison, and so many people that have been shot and murdered by the Saddam Hussein regime. But any idea that the Iraqi people want to live like that would be just nonsensical, because people don't want to have to live like that. </P>",True,"chemical, WMD, Iraq, FS","Donald Rumsfeld, George W.

266,2002-07-28,Some Top Military Brass Favor Status Quo in Iraq,"Despite the Bush administration's stance on Iraq, many senior U.S. military officers contend that Saddam Hussein poses no immediate threat and the United States should continue its policy of containment rather than invade Iraq. The uniformed military's skepticism would not stop Bush if he were determined to attack Iraq, a White House aide said. ""I assume that if the president decides this is going to happen, they'll go along with it,"" he said. But the military leadership's insistence on airing its concerns already appears to have had an effect. Despite the administration's public rhetoric about Iraq, the view of officials interviewed at the Pentagon in recent days is that there will be no action against Iraq before next spring, and perhaps not even then. They argue that the administration's goal of regime change may well be achieved by Hussein falling into poor health or perhaps by CIA covert operations aimed at toppling him. One oddity of the containment policy is that the military at first was uneasy with its open-ended, indeterminate nature. But over the last decade, the military grew more comfortable with the policy of restraining Iraq through ""no-fly"" zones, naval enforcement of sanctions, and the continuous presence of about 20,000 U.S. military personnel near Iraq's borders. Senior officers believe the policy has been more effective than is generally recognized, officials said. As evidence, the top brass said the approach has deterred Hussein from threatening his neighbors and from backing terrorist organizations. They said it also has prevented him from updating his military equipment. Also, while Iraq unquestionably possesses chemical and biological weapons, defense officials said the current U.S. intelligence assessment is that it has few, if any, operational long-range missiles that could be used to deliver those weapons to attack Israel or other U.S. allies in the region. U.S. intelligence has concluded that Iraq possesses perhaps as many as two dozen Scud ""B"" missiles—with a range of 400 miles—that it managed to hide from international inspectors, but that they are not assembled. Officials said the officers contend that continuing a containment policy is preferable to invading an Iraq that possesses an arsenal of biological and chemical weapons. Another concern is that Iraq could split up under a U.S. attack, potentially leading to chaos and the creation of new anti-American regimes and terrorist sanctuaries in the region.",False,"chemical, biological, Iraq","George W.

268,2002-07-29,Attack on Iraq Requires Clear Al Qaeda Link,"Bush administration lawyers have concluded that establishing a link between Al Qaeda terrorists and Iraq would provide all the legal justification the administration needs to launch military action against Saddam Hussein's regime, U.S. officials say. An intensive effort by U.S. intelligence to establish such a link is being driven, in part, by a conclusion reached in recent weeks by White House and Pentagon legal and legislative advisers. They believe that connecting Iraq and the September 11 terrorist attacks would allow the administration to avoid debates at the United Nations and in Congress over what some would call an unprovoked strike. The administration has sought a link between Iraq and Al Qaeda since the first days after September 11. The idea of using that connection as legal grounds for military action has gelled only recently, however, as the administration has developed its military options and confronted the difficulty of gaining support from allies for attacking Iraq. Countries such as Russia and France, both permanent U.N. Security Council members, have been pushing to ease sanctions on Iraq and have raised concerns about an unprovoked attack. Administration experts are looking to U.N. Security Council Senate Joint Resolution 23, both of which were passed in the days after the September 11 terror attacks, as the legal basis for a military campaign against Iraq. Many congressional leaders—including those who support the use of force against Saddam—worry that the administration needs a clearer justification than the belief that Iraq has developed weapons of mass destruction. Only tenuous links have surfaced between Iraq and Al Qaeda. No evidence has been found of close cooperation or of Iraqi involvement in the September 11 attacks. A senior Pentagon intelligence official said that merely finding Al Qaeda members hiding in Iraq would not be enough to provide legal cover, according to an administration analysis.

271,2002-07-30,Defense Department&nbsp;Briefing by&nbsp;Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld,"<P>Question: Mr. Secretary, you were asked in Suffolk yesterday, perhaps naively, why the United States simply doesn't just bomb Iraq's weapons of mass destruction out of existence. And you said clearly that a lot of those sites are buried deep underground. Some sites are in trailers, which can be camouflaged and are very mobile, and that air power alone simply couldn't handle that kind of task. Would it then follow that any military attempt—any military attempt—to oust Saddam, which would be a much more daunting task, could not be accomplished by air power alone, that it would require a lot of troops if one was to do that?<BR><BR>Rumsfeld: Well, as your question properly suggested, that's a big ""if"" as to whether or not anyone intends to do that. The point I think I was making is that not just in Iraq but in other countries, as well, the extent to which countries are burrowing underground and—is—makes the task of knowing about, let alone dealing with weapons of mass destruction very difficult. The extent to which dual-use capabilities enable countries to have things that are mobile, that are not known to others, makes it difficult. </P>  <P>If you go back and think of just in the case of Iraq, the number of inspectors who were milling around that country for a good many—good, long period and the difficulty they had except when prompted by defectors to know where things were—so it's a difficult job, and—but I don't know that I set in the context of—that you moved it the question. <BR><BR>Question: No, but I— <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: Yeah. Right. <BR><BR>Question: My question: Would it then follow that any military attempt to oust Saddam would be much more daunting than that? Would it be likely to require ground troops as well as air power? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: I don't know that I'd want to make a judgment on anything regarding that, because it would conceivably leave the wrong impression, and I could make—I already know of one instance: If the Iraqi military turned on them, it probably wouldn't require anything. </P>  <P>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Question: If inspectors should be allowed back in, regardless, do you think they would find all the weapons of mass destruction or would that be insufficient? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: It would take such a thoroughly intrusive inspection regime, agreed to and then lived up to by Iraq, that it's difficult to comprehend—even begin to think that they might accept such a regime. It would have to be without notice, it would have to be anywhere, any time. And I still suspect it would require the assistance of defectors and people—insiders, simply because of the ease of hiding things. <BR><BR>Question: Mr. Secretary, do you believe that Iraq is using mobile biological-weapons laboratories in trailers? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Yeah, I think it's safe to say that Saddam Hussein and his regime have developed the ability to make any number of things mobile. They have mobile missiles. They have mobile radars. They move around a lot of things to avoid detection or if not detection, at least to avoid having them attacked.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Question: So bioweapons laboratories on the move is something you believe they're using? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: I think that that's a reasonable conclusion. <BR><BR>Question: And to follow up briefly— <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: I would go on and say that it really may not even be necessary that they be mobile, because with no inspectors on the ground, there's nobody there to even look at them. But biological weapons can be developed in such small—rooms like this, that they need not be big or noticeable. <BR><BR>Question: And to follow up briefly: You gave a brief synopsis of what the feeling is about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq yesterday. What is the Pentagon's belief or status of what Iraq is working on or has? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Oh, that they have chemical weapons and biological weapons and they have an appetite for nuclear weapons and have been working on them for a good many years, and that there's an awful lot we don't know about their programs.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Question: Mr. Secretary? <BR><BR>Question: Can I follow up on that? Mr. Secretary, as the questions at the briefing illustrate, there's an awful lot of speculation these days, in the press and among the punditry, about possible U.S. military action in Iraq, and the downside risk of some of that action, everything from Saddam using chemical weapons, to <EM>The New York Times</EM> weighing in with a story suggesting it might have a negative impact on the U.S. economy. Do you believe that you and other members of the Bush administration have adequately prepared the American people for what might be at stake if the U.S. were to exercise a military option in Iraq? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: Well, I don't—first of all, we don't know if the United States is—would exercise a military option with respect to Iraq. And therefore, my impression is that what's happened in the world—and it's not just this administration, it's been a good many years that people have had as a policy for this country regime change in Iraq. The Congress has opined on it, the prior administration opined on it, clearly President Bush has. There are a variety of ways to address it, diplomatically, economic and military. We've got Operation Northern Watch and Southern Watch going on. <BR><BR>You know, it is certainly a relatively easy thing for someone to write an article or a column or make a speech or comment on ""this could happen or that could happen or this could happen or that could happen."" And your question is, has the administration disabused the world of all of those conceivable things? And the answer is, I suspect not. But the American people have a very good center of gravity, and I don't know that we've not done anything we should have done. I think we've discussed things and talked about things to the extent they've matured and developed in a fairly forthright, direct way. <BR><BR>Question: So you don't agree with members of Congress who think that the administration has not been forthcoming with the American people? And they intend to hold hearings to try to get some of this information out in front of the public. <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: I think your statement that that's the view of the Congress suggests that there's 435 members of the House and 100 members of the Senate who have a common view. And they don't. They're all over the lot, as people are, as anyone looking at things. They look at it and have different views. There may very well be some members of the Congress who feel that way. I personally happen to think that if there are hearings, that's something that the Congress does from time to time. I've been asked questions about Iraq up in hearings already. I don't know that that's notable. I don't know that it demonstrates any particular opposition to anything, because there's nothing to oppose at the moment. <BR><BR>Question: Given all the speculation about this plan and that plan, could you tell us, where is the Pentagon and the U.S. military today in terms of planning for any possible military operation in Iraq? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: Th—several things I would say. And maybe Pete'll [General Peter Pace] want to comment, but one of the responsibilities of the Department of Defense is to see that we have thought through a host of different contingencies and possibilities. So, as long as I've been aware, as long as there's been a Department of Defense, and certainly as long as I've been around—and that's a long time—there have always been on-the-shelf plans—sometimes they're called war plans; sometimes they're called contingency plans; sometimes they're called operations plans; sometimes they're called NEO's, noncombatant evacuation plans; a whole series of, you know, many handfuls of conceivable things that could happen in the world are looked at by this department, thought through, analyzed, and then a plan is developed. <BR><BR>I've never seen a plan implemented. What happens is, when something happens that's close to that type of an event, the plan is taken off the shelf, looked at, and then recast, recalibrated to fit the fact pattern that actually occurred. Because these things are done one, one-and-a-half-years, cycles where they're then renewed and refreshed. </P>  <P>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Question: And what's the status of the possible Iraq invasion plan that— <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: We don't talk about specific plans. We talk about 'em generically, like I just did. <BR><BR>Question: Mr. Secretary, last week it was reported that Iraq was seeking specialty steel for a centrifuge system, which is a sign that it's reconstituting its nuclear program. Are you concerned about Iraq's efforts to build these facilities for nuclear fuel, for nuclear weapons? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: Well, without seeming to validate any particular piece of reporting—let me put it that way—<SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>needless to say, this individual and others ought to be interested and concerned any time any country that's certainly a terrorist state and on the terrorist list and has relationships with global terrorist networks tries/is seen as developing and making more mature any of their weapon-of-mass-destruction activities.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Question: Nothing specific related to the nuclear program? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>I think I've answered it about—we would—I would always be concerned when any terrorist state, and particularly any state that has relationships with terrorist networks, is indicating that it is further developing and maturing weapon-of-mass-destruction programs of any type.</SPAN> </P>  <P>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Question: You say that Saddam has chemical and biological weapons, but it's been pretty vague what you've said. And I wonder if there's any way you can get into detail about exactly what he has. And clearly, a lot of this is classified. But how do you build support, both here and abroad, for regime change or possibly military action without any more detailed information about his WMD [weapons of mass destruction] capabilities? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: Well, one of the ways you do it is you—you're right, to the extent people are reading off the same sheet of music, they tend to sign the same song. And reasonable people looking at the same set of facts tend to come to reasonably similar conclusions. And we have been briefing our NATO allies, we've been briefing members of the House and Senate, we've been briefing others. And it just takes time for people to internalize what's taking place every month, every week, every year. <BR><BR>Question: Can you brief us? (Laughter.) <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: Yes? <BR><BR>Question: Mr. Secretary, what global terrorist networks do you believe that Iraq has relationships with? Is Al Qaeda one of those terrorist networks? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Sure.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Question: Could you elaborate on that, sir? (Laughter.) Because I don't think any—I think the evidence that—talked about in the press about that has been a bit murky. Could you— <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: Well, life's murky. I mean, we're not on the ground down there. But are there Al Qaeda in Iraq? Yes. Are there Al Qaeda in Iran? Yes. Are there Al Qaeda in the United States? Yes. <BR><BR>Question: Has there been state sponsorship, for example— <BR><BR>Question: (Off mike.) (Laughter.) <BR><BR>Question: Oh, oh! <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: Ohhh! Dim the lights! (Laughs; laughter.) <BR><BR>Question: Many months ago you were asked whether—right after September 11th, whether you thought there might have been state assistance or state sponsorship to the people who perpetrated 9/11. What do you think now, 11 months later, whatever it is? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>There's no question but that there was state assistance. How in the world could Al Qaeda have trained thousands of people in Afghanistan absent state assistance?</SPAN> <BR><BR>Question: But I meant other than allowing them to be in Afghanistan. Do you think there's other states? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Well, are they in Iran now? Yes. Are they in Iraq now? Yes. The fact that they're in the United States and we don't tolerate it does not mean that some other countries that they're in do tolerate it. Yes?</SPAN> <BR><BR>Question: Mr. Secretary, the bill of particulars that you have laid out over the months with regard to Iraq has to do with the leadership, the threat to its neighbors, the evidence that they are interested in building weapons of mass destruction, possible—and the concern that these weapons of mass destruction might be passed to terrorist groups. Hence, regime change is something the U.S. favors. The same can be said in the bill of particulars for Iran, North Korea, Syria. Does the United States, do you, favor regime change and potentially military action against those countries that are doing often the same things and some even greater support for terrorism than is Iraq? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: Would it be a good thing for the world if the government of Iran stopped repressing its people? You bet. If you're asking me personally. Now, is that our policy in the United States government? Well, the president articulates U.S. policy, and the secretary of state. </P>  <P>But there's no question but that the people of Iran are being ruled by a minority faction with severe fundamentalist rules and laws and requirements and are imposing that on the Iranian people. And it's harmful to them. And goodness knows, I would wish them better than that. I have a feeling that the people of Iran know that. And I have a feeling that in my adult lifetime we may still see the people of Iran do something about that regime. </P>  <P>I don't think that's possible in some other countries. In North Korea—the president's talked about that as well. If you think of the people that are starving in that country, the people that are fleeing that country, the people that are in prison camps in that country, one can't help but feel great empathy for the people of Korea. It's a terrible, terrible thing. <BR><BR>Question: The issue here is threat to American vital interests and potential threat to the United States, as you have outlined it with regard to Iraq. Some of those other countries pose an equally great threat to American interests with their ties to terrorist groups and with their already well-established programs for developing weapons of mass destruction. They would seem to be a higher degree of a target for the United States, with the kind of policy that appears to be just focused on Iraq. <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: Well, I don't know that the word—that I would want to leap into a question with the word ""target"" in it. But you're quite right: The policy of the government of the United States has been to regime change for Iraq. That's the Congress and the executive branch both. It has not been that for some other countries. And I guess life's just untidy. And—but you're quite right in pointing out that the other countries, that the president included, for example, in the axis of evil, have some similar characteristics. </P>  <P>I think we should stop. </P>",True,"Axis of Evil, chemical, biological, nuclear, WMD, Al Qaeda, Iraq, FS","Donald Rumsfeld, George W.

Its policies of concealment ensured this. <BR><BR>—We do know that it has had such weapons, has used them, remains at work on them. <BR><BR>—What it has been able to further achieve in the four years without inspection is not clear, is precise terms. That is the inner logic of inspections—you cannot see what you are not permitted to look at. <BR><BR>—Saddam Hussein knows what he is working on and the assets he holds in the WMD field. His refusal to allow inspections to resume has nothing to do with notions of Iraqi sovereignty. It is designed to prevent the discovery of, and to protect, his WMD program. <BR><BR>—Intelligence agencies might know more than they are able to say in public. Certainly what has been published of defector and intelligence reports confirms that, during the past four years, Iraq has been hard at work, across the board, to increase its WMD capability. <BR><BR>—There are a number of deeply disturbing possibilities within Saddam's WMD program which need urgent attention, but especially these: has he acquired a nuclear weapons capability by purchasing it from former Soviet stock; is he working, in the BW [biological warfare] field, on smallpox, plague, ebola? </P>  <P>Why is Saddam so deeply attached to these diabolical weapons and defended this attachment at massive cost to Iraq and its people? </P>  <P>In many respects he has told us himself, in his various public outbursts. They make him strong against enemies within and without Iraq. They support his posturing to lead the Arab world against its enemies. <BR><BR>Even more disturbing than Saddam's goals and view of the world, is his apparently cataclysmic mentality. He surely must know that, especially following September 11, any use by him and indeed any threat of use of WMD against the United States, or possibly its allies, would bring a terrible response. </P>  <P>It would be intelligent for him to now recognize that his WMD capability is an insupportable liability for him and his regime. Yet, he shows no sign of doing so. This is perhaps the ultimate pathology of the man. <BR><BR>Will he make his WMD available to terrorist groups? <BR><BR>I don't know. We do know that Iraq has trained terrorists from around the region and has mounted terrorist actions of its own, as far afield as in South East Asia. But I have seen no evidence of Iraq providing WMD to non-Iraqi terrorist groups. <BR><BR>I suspect that, especially given his psychology and aspirations, Saddam would be reluctant to share what he believes to be an indelible source of his power. </P>  <P>On the elemental question of whether, contrary to assertions authorized by him, Saddam possesses WMD, I would refer to the traditional test of whether or not a person can be judged to have committed a crime: Did the accused have the motive, means, and opportunity? Saddam plainly has had and continues to have, all three. </P>  <P>What should be concluded from these facts? <BR><BR>The resumption of arms control in Iraq is urgently required, but it would have to be serious. If Iraq again refused to cooperate, then to pursue compromised inspections would be dangerous. <BR><BR>If it is decided to take military action against Saddam it will be crucial for it to be for the right reasons. There are, in fact, three: Saddam's flagrant violation of human rights; his continuing refusal to comply with international law as expressed in binding decisions of the Security Council; and his violation of arms control obligations and treaties. </P>",False,"chemical, biological, nuclear, WMD, Iraq",Saddam Hussein,http://www.cfr.org/publication/4687/testimony_by_richard_butler_on_iraq_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction.html,,"SOURCE: Council on Foreign Relations, testimony by Richard Butler on Iraq and weapons of mass destruction, July 31, 2002.",

288,2002-08-05,National Journalists Roundtable Interview with Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld,"Question: Mr. Secretary, what did you think of this offer today by Iraq to let the United States and members of the U.S. Congress come over and inspect possible weapon sites, or they think [sic] are suspected weapon sites. Are they serious do you think, or are they just jerking America's chain? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: The latter. (Laughter.) The regime in Iraq has been very skillful at manipulating the press and putting out disinformation and making themselves look good at the expense of the United States. Anything they say or do is printed as though it's true and carried repeatedly throughout the world as though it were true until someone knocks it down. Of course you try to knock it down but you're not on the ground, you can't. We still have Operation Northern Watch and Southern Watch and every once in awhile they'll shoot at our airplanes and we'll fire back and hit a radar or a fiber optic relay station or something on the ground. And of course the first thing they do is put out a press release saying we killed 16 civilians, men, women and children, it was a hospital or it was a mosque, or something like this. Just flat lies. And how in the world do you run around and undo all of that? <BR><BR>So what have they done historically? <BR><BR>First of all we had inspectors crawling all over that country, the U.N. did, and they couldn't find much of anything until there was a defector, Saddam Hussein's son-in-law, who had been involved with some of these programs and cued the U.N. inspectors and said here's where you have to go look an they go look and they got in and they found things. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>They have lied about, under the rules they were supposed to end their weapons of mass destruction programs, they didn't. They continued with them, and they still have chemical and biological weapons and they're still working on nuclear weapons. Even though the U.N. resolutions said that they would do that, and they agreed to do it in 1991, and they haven't done it.</SPAN> <BR><BR>So they allow inspectors in at times of their convenience and their choosing and have hidden things. They have things that are mobile, they have things that are underground. It is next to impossible with a group of people like that who have spent years digging underground for a handful of—I can't think of anything funnier than a handful of congressmen wandering around thinking—you've seen the size of the country? They'd have to be there for the next 50 years trying to find something. (Laughter.) I mean, it's a joke. What they'll do is every time they get worried about whether or not the international community is unhappy with them then they'll offer to have inspectors come in, or they'll invite somebody to come in and do something.

289,2002-08-06,Secretary General Kofi Annan Reaffirms United Nations&nbsp;Role in Iraq Weapons Inspections,"Secretary General Kofi Annan told Iraq formally in a letter yesterday [August 6] that the United Nations Security Council, not the government of Saddam Hussein, would decide on what basis weapons inspectors would return to Iraq after a four-year break. Replying to an invitation from Iraq's foreign minister, Naji Sabri, sent to him last Thursday [August 1], Mr. Annan not only restated requirements for inspections laid down by the Security Council but told the Iraqis that their invitation should be addressed directly to the head of the inspection commission, Hans Blix. The Iraqis had asked Mr. Annan to send Dr. Blix and his team. <BR><BR>Mr. Annan's response appears to have ended Iraq's hopes of circumventing the Security Council's guidelines for the functioning of the inspection panel it created late in 1999, the United Nations Monitoring, Verification, and Inspection Commission. Dr. Blix, a Swedish international lawyer and former director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, became executive chairman of the new commission in March 2000. ""Since the executive chairman of Unmovic reports directly to the Security Council,"" Mr. Annan wrote in his seven-paragraph letter, ""and in accordance with your own wishes, I have conveyed your letter to the Security Council and discussed its contents with its members."" Mr. Annan wrote that the Council welcomed the first invitation in four years to bring inspectors back to Iraq, where Dr. Blix's commission has never been invited to go. <BR><BR>But, Mr. Annan added, the resolution creating the inspection commission had been ""clear and precise"" in setting out what Iraq must do in order to have sanctions imposed in 1990 lifted. <BR><BR>That includes allowing inspectors to return to investigate what has changed since the last inspections. The inspectors would draw up a plan within 60 days to tackle unresolved issues surrounding Iraqi biological, chemical, and nuclear programs as well as missile development beyond what is allowed for defense, and Iraq would have to comply with that plan.",False,"chemical, biological, nuclear, WMD","Kofi Annan, Hans Blix, Saddam Hussein",,,"SOURCE: Barbara Crossette, ""Annan Reaffirms U.N.

290,2002-08-07,Speech on President Bush's Economic Security Agenda by Vice President Dick Cheney,"<P>The Vice President: The attacks of 9/11 confront us with a whole new set of considerations—from our ongoing vulnerability to international terrorism, to the possibility that terrorists will gain access to weapons of mass destruction. In the rubble of Afghanistan we've found confirmation, if any were needed, that [Osama] bin Laden and the Al Qaeda network are seriously interested in nuclear and radiological weapons, and in biological and chemical agents. It's one thing to have that sort of possibility discussed in foreign policy seminars. It's quite another to have in your hand documents clearly describing their aspirations and plans for acquiring these capabilities, so that they can use them against the United States and our friends and allies around the world. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>In the case of Saddam Hussein, we have a dictator who is clearly pursuing these capabilities—and has used them, both in his war against Iran and against his own people.</SPAN> In the words of a recent editorial in <EM>The Economist</EM>, ""wishful thinking in the face of mortal danger is bad policy."" And as President Bush has made very clear, the government of the United States will not look the other way as threats accumulate against us. </P>  <P>[text omitted]<BR><BR>The Vice President: (in progress)—Sooner or later, the international community is going to have to deal with that. But again, I think it's important for us to remember that the transgressor here, the one who has not complied with the U.N. Security Council resolutions, the one who has not lived up to the commitments that were undertaken at the end of the Gulf War, is Saddam Hussein. And I think the burden ought to be on him to prove that he, in fact, is in compliance. And I'm not sure at all that that's likely to happen. So the international community will have to come together in some fashion and figure out how we're going to deal with this growing threat to peace and stability in the region, and obviously, potentially for the United States itself. <BR><BR>Question: If Iraq agrees to international weapons inspections, would we call off the war—or not move forward in that effort? <BR><BR>The Vice President: Well, let me emphasize that the president has not made a decision at this point to go to war. We're looking at all of our options. It would be irresponsible for us not to do that. But the issue here isn't inspectors. That's a secondary item, if you will. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>The issue is the fact that he's required to dispose of his weapons of mass destruction and the inspectors are merely the device by which the international community can assure itself that he's done so.</SPAN> So many of us I think are skeptical that simply returning the inspectors will solve the problem. A great deal depends upon what conditions they would operate under; would they be able to go anywhere, anytime, without notice on extensive searches? You've got to remember he's had about four years now to hide everything that he's been doing and he's gotten to be very good at that, worked at it very aggressively. So even if you had the return of inspectors, I'm not sure they would be able to do enough to be able to guarantee us and our friends in the region that he had, in fact, complied. He's gotten very good at denial and deception. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>But we do know, as I say, from defectors and from other sources that he continues to have robust programs, and a debate with him over inspectors is simply</SPAN>—I think would be an effort by him to obfuscate and delay and avoid having to live up to the accords that he signed up to at the end of the Gulf War.</P>",True,"chemical, biological, nuclear, WMD, Al Qaeda, Iraq, FS","Richard B.

294,2002-08-09,"Defense Department Press Briefing, Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and General Richard Myers, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff","<P>Question: Mr. Secretary, I wanted to ask you about the comments from House Majority Leader Dick Armey, suggesting that the United States cannot move against Iraq without significant provocation. Are those kinds of statements unhelpful? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: No. Dick Armey's a fine congressman and a good friend, and I think it's important for people to say what they think on these things, and that's the wonderful thing about our country. We have a public debate and dialogue and discussion on important issues. Yes? <BR><BR>Question: Mr. Secretary, to follow on that, he—House Majority Leader Armey said, ""As long as Saddam Hussein behaves himself within his own borders, we should not be addressing any attack or resources against him."" Do you believe that containment of Saddam Hussein has worked, is working? Without getting into the hypotheticals that I know you don't like. <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: Containment has—you can't say it's worked or not worked. It has not done the job in this sense. Economic sanctions, historically—not just in the case of Iraq, but I believe historically—once they're applied, they're effective for a reasonable period of time and then they tend to be eroded for a lot of reasons. People decide they don't agree with them anymore and they start trading. People figure clever ways to get around them with dual-use technologies. People do it illegally across borders, and these are porous borders. And it is very clear that the political and economic sanctions have, with respect to Saddam Hussein, have not worked, the containment. <BR><BR>A third part of the containment, clearly, was Operation Northern and Southern Watch. And we know for a fact that he is continuing to operate in those areas and doing things that it's very hard to stop him from doing because he's got mobile anti-aircraft capabilities, and when he shoots at us, we shoot back. He hasn't hit us, fortuitously. But by the same token, we've not done a great deal of damage to his air defenses or any of his other capabilities. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>The big thing that was there was the weapon of mass destruction issue, and he had agreed, and the U.N. had agreed, that he would not have a WMD program. We know he does have one and he is continuing it.</SPAN> <BR><BR>So there's no way any reasonable person could look at that record and say that it's worked. It hasn't worked and it's not working. It started out working better than it is today, and it's kind of declined, as is the case in most of these types of things, which means that he's moving farther and farther away from the circumstance he was in when they were first imposed.</P>  <P>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Question: You know, are you afraid that you'll have a situation somewhat similar to Afghanistan, where there's groups fighting each other? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: Well, wait a second. Let's go back—before we go to that, let's go back to Afghanistan. Wouldn't it be a wonderful thing if Iraq were similar to Afghanistan, if a bad regime was thrown out, people were liberated, food could come in, borders could be opened, repression could stop, prisons could be opened? I mean, it would be fabulous. The idea that Afghanistan should be held up as something that one would not want to have happen is just exactly opposite from the truth. Afghanistan is a model of what can happen if people are liberated and begin to try to elect their own people and people are allowed to vote who weren't allowed to vote and people are allowed to work who weren't allowed to work. It is a breathtaking accomplishment. <BR><BR>Now, of course one worries about what will follow. We worried about it in Afghanistan, and we still are. We're still anxious to see that government put in place by the Afghan people find its sea legs and start getting some support from the rest of the world and have these countries that promised to send money send money, instead of promising to send money. There's a lot of money that hasn't been sent, and it needs to go into the Karzai government, into the central government, so he has the ability to begin to assert some influence in the country. <BR><BR>He's got to have money to pay for his army and for his border patrol and for his policemen. He has to have money to be able to show that the circumstance in Afghanistan today is—to the people out in the regions, that it's better than it was before, and they ought not to allow the Taliban to come back and they ought not to allow the Taliban to invite the Al Qaeda back into their country, and they ought not to turn it back into a terrorist training camp. And that's something that takes time and effort and it—because it's reasonably democratic, it's kind of untidy. And one looks at the untidiness and says, ""Oh, my goodness, it's untidy!"" Well, my goodness, democracy's untidy. Freedom is untidy. Liberation is untidy. It's a very good thing that's happened in Afghanistan, and all this Henny-Penny ""The sky is falling!"" and ""Isn't it terrible?"" is nonsense. <BR><BR>Question: The seven— <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: I'm coming to Iraq. I'm just a little slow. (Laughter.) Now, with respect to your question. (Laughter.) <BR><BR>Question: (Off mike)—sufficiently chastised, huh? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: (Laughs.) Oh, my! I needed a hook to hang my anger on, so I— <BR><BR>Question: Glad I could oblige, sir. <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: (Laughs.) The situation—any time someone wants to tear down what is, you have the responsibility of suggesting something better. And what we have said thus far is relatively simple and straightforward, and it fits the act of Congress, the statute, the government policy of our country that passed the Congress of the United States. <BR><BR>It is—we would like to see a country that is a single country, and not have Iraq broken up into pieces. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>We would like to see a country that forswears weapons of mass destruction and says: ""That's really not in the interests of the people. It's not in the interests of the region, and we're not going to take the people's money and invest in chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons,"" which they are doing today.</SPAN> Money that's coming from the so-called food-for-oil—or oil-for-food money, that's not going for food; it's going for weapons of mass destruction. <BR><BR>Third, we'd like to see a regime that decided it didn't need to invade its neighbors. Kind of a reasonable thing. Certainly would make that part of the world a more peaceful place. <BR><BR>Fourth, we would think that it would be desirable if the people of the country had a voice in their country, and that these institutions that have served other countries across the globe so well, of some reasonable rule of law, and some respect for the rights of minorities, and some way for people to have their views represented with respect to their government. <BR><BR>I don't have a template or a model in my mind at all. But it seems to me that if you dropped a plumb line through all of the opposition groups and said what would they like, I would think the things I've just said would be very high on their list. If you dropped a plumb line through the nations of the world that are doing reasonably well for their people, you would find that those things I just said would be reasonably representative of all of those countries. And conversely, if you dropped a plumb line through all the terrorist states, you'd find they look very much like each other; that they're dictatorial and they're repressive and people do not have rights and people are jailed without any rights, people are not allowed to vote, except in a sham election, and the will of the center of the government is imposed on them viciously. <BR><BR>And I thank you for the question. <BR><BR>Last question. <BR><BR>Question: Mr. Secretary, to go back to your statement about containment not working, this government pursued a policy of containment against the Soviet Union— <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: But I said it isn't work or not work, it's gradations. <BR><BR>Question: Well— <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>It's clearly worked for a while, it clearly has delayed things, it's clearly made life more complicated for Saddam Hussein. But if by ""work"" you mean has it actually stopped them from WMD activity? No.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Question: Well, the Soviet Union was a greater threat to us and the world, you know, than Iraq is, and yet that—containment was our policy for 50 years and it finally worked. <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: It did indeed. <BR><BR>Question: So why won't it work against Iraq? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: Well, there are a variety reasons. And that's an important question. One is, the Soviet Union was a nuclear power, as were we, and we developed a way to deter each other and dissuade each other from—we persuaded the Soviet Union that they could not endlessly expand their empire by absorbing other countries. We persuaded them that it was clearly not in their interest to think they could threaten the use of or use nuclear weapons against the United States or Western Europe to their advantage; that the penalty would be so severe that it was not in their interest. <BR><BR>We then, thanks to successive generations of Americans and Western Europeans, fashioned institutions like NATO and went into our taxpayers' pockets and took dollars and invested so that we had sufficient strength to make that deterrent credible and to, in fact, successfully contain a large nation with an appetite for a growing empire. And it worked, and it took 50 years before they threw the towel in. <BR><BR>Why doesn't that work for a terrorist organization, is your question, why doesn't it work for a terrorist state? The terrorist organization does not have armies, navies, or air forces that you can demonstrate to them that you can deal with them symmetrically; they have asymmetrical advantages because they're willing to kill innocent men, and women and children, they're willing to attack anyplace, anytime, using a whole host of techniques. <BR><BR>And the difference is when those terrorists and terrorist networks begin to move towards weapons of mass destruction, and have said publicly, repeatedly, a host of things that indicate that they want them, that indicate that they're getting them and have them, in some respects, and are continuing to have them mature every year, and that they're getting closer and closer to having even more severe and more powerful and more lethal weapons, and it's pretty clear they're not deterred by the things that would normally deter a country or a terrorist network. A terrorist network has—Al Qaeda has no nation to lose. <BR><BR>Question: But Iraq does. <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: Iraq does. And so your question is, why aren't they deterred by our nuclear capability? Well, I would answer it by saying our nuclear power did not deter the war in Korea, it did not deter the war in Vietnam, it did not deter Desert Storm. In no case did anyone in the United States or Western Europe believe that the deterrent that worked on the Soviet Union worked across the spectrum. We always knew that as you move down the spectrum, away from a superpower, that the deterrent effect had little effect on those people. Otherwise, you wouldn't have had all those wars, all those conflicts. Otherwise, you wouldn't have had previous terrorist attacks, whether it's Khobar Towers or the Cole or the U.S. embassies or any number of things. <BR><BR>So, there is a distinct difference between what works in one case and what works in another case. It doesn't mean that containment is a bad concept. It simply means that one ought not think that one size fits all, that there's a silver bullet that worked 50 years—for 50 years with the Soviet Union, and that same element of dissuasion would necessarily work for all these other things, when we've already got evidence that it didn't work on dozens of things throughout the past 50 years. <BR><BR>Question: General Myers— <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: Goodbye.

Lugar (R-Indiana) and several others said during talk-show interviews that President Bush could make the case justifying a preemptive strike against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, who U.S. officials say is building stocks of biological and chemical weapons and has sought nuclear capability. <BR><BR>Lugar, who is poised to become the ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, compared the threat from Hussein to the September 11 attacks the administration believes were carried out by Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network. <BR><BR>""The president has to make the case that, in this particular instance, to wait for the attack, to wait for the provocation, is to invite a very, very large disaster,"" Lugar said on CBS's <EM>Face the Nation</EM>.<BR><BR>Bush, Lugar said, ""can describe this very well with the illustration of those terrorists who flew into the World Trade Center and into the Pentagon. That was preemptive, without warning, fortunately without weapons of mass destruction."" <BR><BR>The remarks by Lugar and other Republicans came after comments last week by House Majority Leader Richard K. Armey (R-Texas), who said the United States should not attack Iraq without sufficient cause. <BR><BR>Sen. Carl M. Levin (D-Michigan) added to the criticism yesterday, arguing that ""containment of Saddam is so far working."" <BR><BR>""He would not, in my judgment, initiate an attack with a weapon of mass destruction, because it would lead to his own destruction,"" Levin said on NBC's <EM>Meet the Press</EM>.

I'm wondering— <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: Who said that? <BR><BR>Question: Iraq's information minister. Wondering what your perception is about— <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: I'm glad you didn't say ""reliable sources."" (Laughter.) <BR><BR>Question: What is your perception of this back-and-forth about weapons inspectors and the statements coming out of Baghdad about them? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: Well, what's my view of that? I really don't have one. It seems to be it's like a broken record. It's been—they agreed to have inspectors. They threw the inspectors out. The inspectors are still out, now for a period of years. And they're still not allowed back in. What else can one say? They're in violation of the U.N. resolutions. <BR><BR>Question: Do you still believe that even a vigorous weapons inspection program would not be able to find the weapons Saddam Hussein has had four years to hide? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: The—it seems to me, and I'm no weapons inspector, so I'm no expert on the subject, but the biggest successes that were achieved by inspectors when inspectors were permitted in were achieved as a result of information that came from defectors. And they were then able to use that information, go into areas and find some things. And when they found some things, Iraq admitted that they were the things that they said they were: chemical, biological weapons of various types. <BR><BR>It is a big country. They've had years to do what they want to do. They have done a great deal of underground tunneling. They have things that are mobile. It makes it very difficult for inspectors under the best of circumstances to find things. <BR><BR>And I just think that a regime—an inspection regime would have to be so intrusive; it'd have to be anytime, anyplace. You'd have to be undoubtedly able to talk to anyone. You'd have to be able to sometimes talk to people outside of the country, with their families with them, because, as you may recall, the defector who went out, when he returned to Iraq, was killed by Saddam Hussein—two of them. I believe they were sons-in-law of Saddam Hussein. <BR><BR>So if you can't get access to people to get information and access on a basis that they feel safe and that their families feel safe, it would seem to me it would be very difficult. <BR><BR>But we're not anywhere near close that—close to that.

I do not personally yet have a good sense of precisely what they have agreed to do by way of trade. <BR><BR>There is—there's two possible effects. One effect is on Iraq, and Iraq has been able to develop a good deal of additional strength by virtue of both legal trade, under the so-called U.N.-monitored oil-for-food, where the trade is supposed to be, oil goes out and money comes in to buy food and things, but in fact, a good deal of the money's going in to buy things like dump trucks that are then—the back end is taken off, and artillery and rocket pieces are put on the back of these so-called dump trucks, and they are able to continuously improve and strengthen their military capability in ways that are unhelpful to their neighbors and unhelpful to other countries. <BR><BR>Interestingly, from the standpoint of Russia, there's another effect. Russia has an economy, a gross domestic product that's probably about the size of Holland's. It's anxious to connect with the West and be seen as an environment that's hospitable to investment. To the extent that Russia decides that it wants to parade its relationships with countries like Iraq and Libya and Syria and Cuba and North Korea, it sends a signal out across the globe that that is what Russia thinks is a good thing to do, to deal with the terrorist states, to have them as their relationship-developers. What that tells—(audio break from source)—but shouldn't have those capabilities, it hurts them, because people all across the globe, business people can make a decision: Where do they want to put a plant? Where do they want to invest? Where do they want to have a relationship? To the extent that country is saying to the world that, in fact, they want to be known as close personal friends of Saddam Hussein and Fidel Castro and Kim Jong Il and those folks, it sends a signal that is harmful to them, it seems to me. <BR><BR>So my guess is that we'll see, as a country like Russia kind of migrates away from where it was as the Soviet Union and tries to connect with the West—that we'll see them—hopefully, at least—spending more time with Western Europe and North America and countries that have freer political systems and freer economic systems and that have greater respect for their people, rather than spending their time and investing in places like Iraq. <BR><BR>I thought that was a very measured response.

317,2002-08-26,Vice President Dick Cheney Speaks at Veterans Convention,"In this war we've assembled a broad coalition of civilized nations that recognize the danger and are working with us on all fronts. The president has made very clear that there is no neutral ground in the fight against terror. Those who harbor terrorists share guilt for the acts they commit. Under the Bush Doctrine, a regime that harbors or supports terrorists will be regarded as hostile to the United States. <BR><BR>The Taliban has already learned that lesson, but Afghanistan was only the beginning of a lengthy campaign. Were we to stop now, any sense of security we might have would be false and temporary. There is a terrorist underworld out there, spread among more than 60 countries. The job we have will require every tool at our means of diplomacy, of finance, of intelligence, of law enforcement, and of military power. But we will, over time, find and defeat the enemies of the United States. In the case of Osama bin Laden—as President Bush said recently—""If he's alive, we'll get him. If he's not alive—we already got him."" (Applause.) <BR><BR>But the challenges to our country involve more than just tracking down a single person or one small group. Nine-eleven and its aftermath awakened this nation to danger, to the true ambitions of the global terror network, and to the reality that weapons of mass destruction are being sought by determined enemies who would not hesitate to use them against us. <BR><BR>It is a certainty that the Al Qaeda network is pursuing such weapons, and has succeeded in acquiring at least a crude capability to use them. We found evidence of their efforts in the ruins of Al Qaeda hideouts in Afghanistan. And we've seen in recent days additional confirmation in videos recently shown on CNN—pictures of Al Qaeda members training to commit acts of terror, and testing chemical weapons on dogs. Those terrorists who remain at large are determined to use these capabilities against the United States and our friends and allies around the world. <BR><BR>As we face this prospect, old doctrines of security do not apply. In the days of the Cold War, we were able to manage the threat with strategies of deterrence and containment. But it's a lot tougher to deter enemies who have no country to defend. And containment is not possible when dictators obtain weapons of mass destruction, and are prepared to share them with terrorists who intend to inflict catastrophic casualties on the United States. <BR><BR>The case of Saddam Hussein, a sworn enemy of our country, requires a candid appraisal of the facts. After his defeat in the Gulf War in 1991, Saddam agreed under to U.N. Security Council Resolution 687 to cease all development of weapons of mass destruction. He agreed to end his nuclear weapons program. He agreed to destroy his chemical and his biological weapons. He further agreed to admit U.N. inspection teams into his country to ensure that he was in fact complying with these terms. <BR><BR>In the past decade, Saddam has systematically broken each of these agreements. The Iraqi regime has in fact been very busy enhancing its capabilities in the field of chemical and biological agents. And they continue to pursue the nuclear program they began so many years ago. These are not weapons for the purpose of defending Iraq; these are offensive weapons for the purpose of inflicting death on a massive scale, developed so that Saddam can hold the threat over the head of anyone he chooses, in his own region or beyond. <BR><BR>On the nuclear question, many of you will recall that Saddam's nuclear ambitions suffered a severe setback in 1981 when the Israelis bombed the Osirak reactor. They suffered another major blow in Desert Storm and its aftermath. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>But we now know that Saddam has resumed his efforts to acquire nuclear weapons. Among other sources, we've gotten this from the firsthand testimony of defectors—including Saddam's own son-in-law, who was subsequently murdered at Saddam's direction. Many of us are convinced that Saddam will acquire nuclear weapons fairly soon.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Just how soon, we cannot really gauge. Intelligence is an uncertain business, even in the best of circumstances. This is especially the case when you are dealing with a totalitarian regime that has made a science out of deceiving the international community. Let me give you just one example of what I mean. Prior to the Gulf War, America's top intelligence analysts would come to my office in the Defense Department and tell me that Saddam Hussein was at least five or perhaps even 10 years away from having a nuclear weapon. After the war we learned that he had been much closer than that, perhaps within a year of acquiring such a weapon. <BR><BR>Saddam also devised an elaborate program to conceal his active efforts to build chemical and biological weapons. And one must keep in mind the history of U.N. inspection teams in Iraq. Even as they were conducting the most intrusive system of arms control in history, the inspectors missed a great deal. Before being barred from the country, the inspectors found and destroyed thousands of chemical weapons, and hundreds of tons of mustard gas and other nerve agents. <BR><BR>Yet Saddam Hussein had sought to frustrate and deceive them at every turn, and was often successful in doing so. I'll cite one instance. During the spring of 1995, the inspectors were actually on the verge of declaring that Saddam's programs to develop chemical weapons and longer-range ballistic missiles had been fully accounted for and shut down. Then Saddam's son-in-law suddenly defected and began sharing information. Within days the inspectors were led to an Iraqi chicken farm. Hidden there were boxes of documents and lots of evidence regarding Iraq's most-secret weapons programs. That should serve as a reminder to all that we often learned more as the result of defections than we learned from the inspection regime itself. <BR><BR>To the dismay of the inspectors, they in time discovered that Saddam had kept them largely in the dark about the extent of his program to mass-produce VX, one of the deadliest chemicals known to man. And far from having shut down Iraq's prohibited missile programs, the inspectors found that Saddam had continued to test such missiles, almost literally under the noses of the U.N. inspectors. <BR><BR>Against that background, a person would be right to question any suggestion that we should just get inspectors back into Iraq, and then our worries will be over. Saddam has perfected the game of cheat and retreat, and is very skilled in the art of denial and deception. A return of inspectors would provide no assurance whatsoever of his compliance with U.N. resolutions. On the contrary, there is a great danger that it would provide false comfort that Saddam was somehow ""back in his box."" <BR><BR>Meanwhile, he would continue to plot. Nothing in the last dozen years has stopped him—not his agreements; not the discoveries of the inspectors; not the revelations by defectors; not criticism or ostracism by the international community; and not four days of bombings by the U.S. in 1998. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>What he wants is time and more time to husband his resources, to invest in his ongoing chemical and biological weapons programs, and to gain possession of nuclear arms. </SPAN><BR><BR>Should all his ambitions be realized, the implications would be enormous for the Middle East, for the United States, and for the peace of the world. The whole range of weapons of mass destruction then would rest in the hands of a dictator who has already shown his willingness to use such weapons, and has done so, both in his war with Iran and against his own people. Armed with an arsenal of these weapons of terror, and seated atop 10 percent of the world's oil reserves, Saddam Hussein could then be expected to seek domination of the entire Middle East, take control of a great portion of the world's energy supplies, directly threaten America's friends throughout the region, and subject the United States or any other nation to nuclear blackmail. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Simply stated, there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction. There is no doubt he is amassing them to use against our friends, against our allies, and against us.</SPAN> And there is no doubt that his aggressive regional ambitions will lead him into future confrontations with his neighbors—confrontations that will involve both the weapons he has today, and the ones he will continue to develop with his oil wealth. <BR><BR>Ladies and gentlemen, there is no basis in Saddam Hussein's conduct or history to discount any of the concerns that I am raising this morning. We are, after all, dealing with the same dictator who shoots at American and British pilots in the no-fly zone, on a regular basis, the same dictator who dispatched a team of assassins to murder former President Bush as he traveled abroad, the same dictator who invaded Iran and Kuwait, and has fired ballistic missiles at Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Israel, the same dictator who has been on the State Department's list of state sponsors of terrorism for the better part of two decades. <BR><BR>In the face of such a threat, we must proceed with care, deliberation, and consultation with our allies. I know our president very well. I've worked beside him as he directed our response to the events of 9/11. I know that he will proceed cautiously and deliberately to consider all possible options to deal with the threat that an Iraq ruled by Saddam Hussein represents. And I am confident that he will, as he has said he would, consult widely with the Congress and with our friends and allies before deciding upon a course of action. He welcomes the debate that has now been joined here at home, and he has made it clear to his national security team that he wants us to participate fully in the hearings that will be held in Congress next month on this vitally important issue. <BR><BR>I am familiar with the arguments against taking action in the case of Saddam Hussein. Some concede that Saddam is evil, power-hungry, and a menace—but that, until he crosses the threshold of actually possessing nuclear weapons, we should rule out any preemptive action. That logic seems to me to be deeply flawed. The argument comes down to this: Yes, Saddam is as dangerous as we say he is, we just need to let him get stronger before we do anything about it. <BR><BR>Yet if we did wait until that moment, Saddam would simply be emboldened, and it would become even harder for us to gather friends and allies to oppose him. As one of those who worked to assemble the Gulf War coalition, I can tell you that our job then would have been infinitely more difficult in the face of a nuclear-armed Saddam Hussein. And many of those who now argue that we should act only if he gets a nuclear weapon, would then turn around and say that we cannot act because he has a nuclear weapon. At bottom, that argument counsels a course of inaction that itself could have devastating consequences for many countries, including our own.",True,"Iraq, chemical, biological, nuclear, WMD, Al Qaeda, FS","Richard B.

326,2002-09-03,Defense Department News Briefing by Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and General Richard Myers,"Question: Mr. Secretary, much has been said and reported about alleged differences between you and the vice president, on one hand, and Secretary [of State Colin] Powell on the other, on a possible preemptive invasion of Iraq to remove Saddam Hussein from power. Secretary Powell indicated over the weekend that he is willing to—in fact, wants inspectors to go back into Iraq. Do you think that there's anything that inspectors in Iraq could do to change this administration's policy to remove Saddam Hussein from power for a regime change? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: Well, with respect to the first part of the question, I came to this town in 1957 to work up on Capitol Hill, and I don't suppose there's been a year in the period since that there haven't been stories just like the ones you're citing here that there are differences of opinions. The truth of the matter is that the president's national security team meets together frequently. We do so in person, we do so on the phone. We have excellent discussions and it is a very friendly, professional, and constructive set of discussions that take place in that process. <BR><BR>I don't know of differences that—there are always differences of perspective, there are differences of—institutional differences from time to time. But the president is the president. He is the one who ran for that office and was elected to that office. He's the one who makes decisions and calibrations and guidance, and he does it very well. I don't know quite why it is that it seems so much easier for folks to personalize things rather than to go to substance. <BR><BR>The subject you raised second, with respect to inspections, is clearly a complicated set of issues. And my understanding—and I hate to even talk about this because someone will contrast it with something that somebody else said that I haven't read or seen and attempt to find a seam between what I'm going to say and what somebody else may have said. But it obviously has been the position of this administration to favor inspections. It is the Iraqis that ended the inspections. That we all know. We protested when the Iraqis threw the inspectors out. <BR><BR>The Iraqis made a conscious decision to tell the international community that the arrangement that they had entered into at the end of the Gulf War involving inspections, and the other undertakings with respect to not developing weapons of mass destruction and the like—they made a conscious decision at various points to negate those agreements, to tell the international community that they no longer would abide by them. And so the offense, if there is one, is committed against the United Nations and the international community. <BR><BR>Would it be nice if they had not thrown the inspectors out? Yes, that would have been preferable. Would it be preferable for inspectors to be able to have anytime, anyplace access so that at least some additional knowledge could be gained? Sure it would. Are the Iraqis—do they have a pattern of denying that? Yes, they do. <BR><BR>Question: Do you think it's possible for inspectors to go in there—you've repeatedly said you don't—do you think it's possible for inspectors to go in there and somehow change this administration's push for a regime change in Baghdad? Do you think it's possible? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: I just simply don't know. Those are judgments that the president will have to make. First of all, I think that the intrusiveness of any inspection regime that would be sufficiently permissive to enable the rest of the world to know that in fact the U.N. resolutions were being fulfilled and lived up to would be such that it's unlikely for the folks there to agree to it. And I haven't seen any inclination on their part to agree to anything except as a ploy from time to time to muse over the possibility we might do this or we might do that and kind of play the international community and the U.N. process like a guitar, plucking the right string at the right moment to delay something. But it would clearly have to be a—for—to fulfill the import of the U.N. resolutions and the understandings that were agreed upon, it would require an inspection regime of such intrusiveness that it—at least thus far, it's unlikely, I think, that those folks would be inclined to agree to even half of it.",False,"Iraq, WMD","Donald Rumsfeld, Richard B.

Is that a viable option? <BR><BR>The President: First of all, I'll be giving a speech on Tuesday—or the 12th—and you can come and listen to it. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>But let me say to you that the issue is not inspectors, the issue is disarmament.

And so I'm going to call upon the world to recognize that he is stiffing the world. And I will lay out and I will talk about ways to make sure that he fulfills his obligations.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Question: Let me just follow up on your opening statement. When you say you're going to seek congressional approval, does that mean, in effect, Congress will have veto authority over your plan to oust Saddam Hussein? <BR><BR>The President: I'm confident we will be able to—I'll be able to work with Congress to deal with this threat to the American people. And that's what I meant. <BR><BR>Question: Mr. President, you talked about Saddam Hussein stiffing the world. In your mind, has the time come to issue the Iraqi leader an ultimatum similar to that that you issued to the Taliban? <BR><BR>The President: I am going to state clearly to the United Nations what I think.

We talk to each other in an open, candid environment. We're all old friends. There are no wars going on within the administration; there's good debate.

Since September 11, we have been tragically reminded that we are vulnerable to evil people. And this vulnerability increases dramatically when evil people have access to weapons of mass destruction. <BR><BR>I know members of Congress agree that Saddam Hussein's regime is still a threat to peace, as it was when you passed the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998. I also know members of the United Nations are angry that this regime continues to thumb its nose at the world, defying at least 16 U.N. Security Council resolutions adopted between 1990 and 1999 that require Iraq to disarm and give up weapons of mass destruction, to stop threatening its neighbors, and to stop oppressing the Iraqi people. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>America intends to lead the way to make certain that the Saddam Hussein regime is not able to threaten anyone in the world with the world's most devastating weapons.</SPAN> <BR><BR>I am in the process of deciding how to proceed. This is an important decision that must be made with great thought and care. Therefore, I welcome and encourage discussion and debate. The Congress will hold hearings on Iraq this month, and I have asked members of my administration to participate fully. <BR><BR>Doing nothing in the face of a grave threat to the world is not an option. At an appropriate time and after consultations with the leadership, I will seek congressional support for U.S. action to do whatever is necessary to deal with the threat posed by Saddam Hussein's regime. The Congress can play an important role in building a national consensus for action. <BR><BR>The international community must also be involved. I have asked [British] Prime Minister Blair to visit America this week to discuss Iraq. I will also reach out to President Chirac of France, President Putin of Russia, President Jiang of China, and other world leaders. I will have these discussions in advance of next week's meeting of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. At that meeting, I will discuss the challenge that the current Iraqi regime represents to the United Nations and the entire international community.

American officials said several efforts to arrange the shipment of the aluminum tubes were blocked or intercepted but declined to say, citing the sensitivity of the intelligence, where they came from or how they were stopped. <BR><BR>The diameter, thickness and other technical specifications of the aluminum tubes had persuaded American intelligence experts that they were meant for Iraq's nuclear program, officials said, and that the latest attempt to ship the material had taken place in recent months.</P>  <P>The attempted purchases are not the only signs of a renewed Iraqi interest in acquiring nuclear arms. President Hussein has met repeatedly in recent months with Iraq's top nuclear scientists and, according to American intelligence, praised their efforts as part of his campaign against the West. <BR><BR>Iraqi defectors who once worked for the nuclear weapons establishment have told American officials that acquiring nuclear arms is again a top Iraqi priority. American intelligence agencies are also monitoring construction at nuclear sites. <BR><BR>While there is no indication that Iraq is on the verge of deploying a nuclear bomb, Iraq's pursuit of nuclear weapons has been cited by hard-liners in the Bush administration to make the argument that the United States must act now, before Mr. Hussein acquires nuclear arms and thus alters the strategic balance in the oil-rich Persian Gulf. Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain met with President Bush today to reaffirm his nation's support for action against Iraq. <BR><BR>Iraq's nuclear program is not Washington's only concern. An Iraqi defector said Mr. Hussein had also heightened his efforts to develop new types of chemical weapons. An Iraqi opposition leader also gave American officials a paper from Iranian intelligence indicating that Mr. Hussein has authorized regional commanders to use chemical and biological weapons to put down any Shiite Muslim resistance that might occur if the United States attacks. <BR><BR>The paper, which is being analyzed by American officials, was provided by Abdalaziz al-Hakim of the Supreme Council of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, an Iran-based group, during his recent visit with other Iraqi opposition leaders in Washington. <BR><BR>Much of the administration's case, however, revolves around Iraq's attempts to develop nuclear weapons and assessments of the pace of the efforts.

Isn't it going to take and do you have that kind of direct evidence [inaudible]? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: You know, the idea of direct evidence is not like a court of law under Article&nbsp;III of our Constitution where your goal is to punish somebody for doing something wrong. That really isn't the case here. This is self defense, and the United States' task is to see that we don't allow an event to happen that then one has to punish someone— <BR><BR>Question: But you can't go to war without American public support and I'm asking don't you need that kind of direct evidence? Or do you have it, to get the American public support or to get a coalition? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: Oh, sure. The evidence is certainly there. The president has to decide what precisely he believes is the best approach. And one thing he'd say is, the one course of action that's not acceptable is doing nothing. <BR><BR>Think of the books that have been written: <EM>Why England Slept; Pearl Harbor, What Happened?</EM> Think of the congressional hearings going on today trying to connect the dots about September 11th. What do those pieces of information mean? What might we have done before the fact? <BR><BR>The task today is to connect those dots before a weapon of mass destruction is used. That's a more difficult task. <BR><BR>Question: There is an argument that goes that we give up our leverage against him if we go to war against him. Our leverage being you export any weapons you have, you use any weapons you have, and effectively you're toast. But if we go in there now, preemptively, don't we give up that leverage to keep him from using them or exploiting those weapons? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: Well, it's interesting. First of all, the president is going before the Congress and the United Nations and will lay down his case on September 12th to the world. It seems to me it's best to wait and see what he proposes. He's not proposed going to war with Iraq. Your questions have buried in them the assumption that that decision's been made. That decision has not been made. <BR><BR>What the president has said is the one thing that's not acceptable is to do nothing. <BR><BR>Question: Why not under the criteria earlier established, go after Iran? They, we know, have weapons of mass destruction. They, we know, have taken care and harbored terrorists. Why not go after them? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: Well, it's interesting. That could be said about a number of terrorist states. <BR><BR>The situation with Iran is, in my view, different. I think you've got a population there that is in ferment. I think the young people and women are putting pressure on the clerics that are controlling that country. I think if we go back in time and recall how rapidly it switched from the Shah of Iran to the Ayatollah, I have a feeling it could switch back. I think it could. That's a country where that's a possibility. <BR><BR>The regime in Iraq is so repressive. There isn't any likelihood that it could be done from within. <BR><BR>Question: So is the goal to disarm Saddam Hussein or is it regime change? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: The goal is what the president has said, and that is the Congress passed a regime-change piece of legislation a number of years ago in a prior administration, and regime change has been the policy of the United States government. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>The question of disarmament is clearly what the task is.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Question: So if inspectors went in tomorrow and somehow found all of his weapons development programs and were able to magically make them go away, that wouldn't be enough? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: The Congress' regime-change legislation would still stand, and obviously when one thinks about the extent to which the people there were oppressed, and the conventional threat Saddam Hussein poses to its neighbors, those problems would still be there but the world would be a lot safer place if, as you say, it all magically happened.

There's a report out of London today that the British government is putting together a dossier that tries to establish a link between Al Qaeda and Iraq. <BR><BR>Without going into the particulars of that report, the president seems to have been arguing in recent weeks that, in fact, there is a link between Iraq and Al Qaeda. Is that true? <BR><BR>Condoleezza Rice: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Well, there are clearly links between Iraq and terrorism, and there are Al Qaeda personnel that have been spotted in Baghdad. There are some evidence that there have been various meetings concerning Iraqi personnel and Al Qaeda personnel.</SPAN> <BR><BR>No one here, Tony, is trying to establish that Saddam Hussein somehow planned and plotted 9/11. But this is a regime that has hostile intent toward the United States, that has all kind of people in Baghdad who are involved in terrorism—Abu Nidal, who also has had links with Al Qaeda. <BR><BR>We are working very hard to put together the full picture. We do think that there are links there, but let's be very clear: There is plenty to indict Saddam Hussein without a direct link to 9/11. He clearly has links to terrorism. <BR><BR>Snow: All right. And links to terrorism would include Al Qaeda? I just want to be certain. <BR><BR>Rice: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Links to terrorism would include Al Qaeda, yes.</SPAN> </P>  <P>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Snow: The president said this week that he would like to see Saddam Hussein submit to complete, open, and unconditional inspections sooner rather than later. He said in a matter of days and weeks, not months and years. <BR><BR>Would you like to see the United Nations Security Council put deadlines, specific deadlines, on his compliance with the 16 Security Council resolutions he's violated? <BR><BR>Rice: Well, the president didn't prejudge the form of how Iraqi compliance might take place. And, in fact, one of the concerns is that whatever we do going forward, that it is different than what we've done in the past, that this time it's effective. <BR><BR>Snow: But that would include deadlines, hard deadlines? <BR><BR>Rice: Clearly, this can't be a matter that goes on and on. And yes, it's going to have to include some kind of deadline. And it's not going to be something that you negotiate with the Iraqi government. <BR><BR>Rice: This is a regime that has flaunted the United Nations security resolutions, that's hiding its weapons of mass destruction activities. Why one would try and negotiate now with the Iraqis what they will accept would be a mystery to us. <BR><BR>So one thing that we want to be very clear on is that when there is an understanding among the Security Council members as to what would constitute Iraqi compliance, it is not an offer to begin negotiations with the Iraqis on what that might look like. <BR><BR>Snow: So, clear conditions, clear deadlines, and then it would be possible under Article VII for the United States or other powers to use military force? <BR><BR>Rice: Well, obviously there will have to be some consequences if Iraq does not comply, but we'll see how those are expressed. <BR><BR>Snow: The president and everybody else in the foreign policy establishment, including you, have been talking a lot about Iraq. Why is it so important to act now, as opposed to a month, two months, three months from now? <BR><BR>Rice: Well, the real question is, why should you wait to attack later? This has been a long history now with Iraq of defiance, since '98—since 1998, the United States has had a regime-change policy. <BR><BR>So we have to do this sooner or later.

When it comes to securing a future for our children and our children's children, we will stay the course. <BR><BR>And that not only means hunting down Al Qaeda and Al Qaeda–type terrorists which hate America.

We owe this to our children. We must anticipate. Somebody said, well, you know, they don't have a nuclear weapon.

368,2002-09-17,U.S. Assertions Go Beyond Its Intelligence,"The Bush administration is expanding on and in some cases contradicting U.S. intelligence reports in making the case for an invasion of Iraq, interviews with administration and intelligence officials indicate. <BR><BR>Administration officials accuse Iraq of having ties to Al Qaeda terrorists and of amassing weapons of mass destruction despite uncertain and sometimes contrary intelligence on these issues, according to officials. <BR><BR>In some cases, top administration officials disagree outright with what the CIA and other intelligence agencies report. For example, they repeat accounts of Al Qaeda members seeking refuge in Iraq and of terrorist operatives meeting with Iraqi intelligence officials, even though U.S. intelligence reports raise doubts about such links. On Iraqi weapons programs, administration officials draw the most pessimistic conclusions from ambiguous evidence. <BR><BR>Although the Bush administration made significant progress last week in generating international and domestic support for a campaign against Iraq, some lawmakers and diplomats question the evidence being assembled by the U.S. and British governments. Hans Blix, the chief United Nations arms inspector, said satellite images of Iraq show no evidence that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein was rebuilding an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction. And House Minority Whip Nancy Pelosi (D-California) said that in secret intelligence briefings, administration officials were presenting ""embellishments"" on information long known about Iraq. <BR><BR>A senior Bush administration official conceded privately that there are large gaps in U.S. knowledge about Iraqi weapons programs but insisted that the only prudent course is to suspect the worst. To give Iraq the benefit of the doubt, officials argue, would be naive and dangerous. <BR><BR>Last week, National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice boiled the administration's case down to a single line that evoked both the uncertainty and the risk associated with Iraq: ""We don't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud."" <BR><BR>The differences between the administration and intelligence officials may be, in part, institutional.

371,2002-09-18,White House Press Briefing by Ari Fleischer,"Question: How much of a delay do you think this entreaty to the United Nations that Iraq has made will put into this process that the president has started at the Security Council? And do you foresee a situation under which inspectors could go back into Iraq without the backing of a tough U.N. resolution? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: I don't know that there will be a delay. The United Nations Security Council has not previously set a vote, the timing for a vote. And based on the consultations that Secretary [of State Colin] Powell has had, and the fact that most of the people he's consulted with have now returned to their capitals for consultations, the process is ongoing. And we'll see exactly the timing of the United Nations Security Council action. But I don't think you can interpret any recent events to suggest there will be a delay. I think the U.N. is moving at the pace that it was going to. <BR><BR>Question: I'm sorry. Does he have a basic problem—problem with the basic structure of UNMOVIC [United Nations Monitoring, Verification, and Inspection Commission]? If you're talking about it not being like the last time—UNMOVIC isn't what UNSCOM [United Nations Special Commission] was. <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: The president has a basic problem with the structure of Saddam Hussein's Iraq. It is Saddam Hussein's Iraq that has frustrated the good works of the inspectors. The inspectors have worked diligently and tried their best to get information about what is happening in Iraq. And that's why I think I can cite to you some of the statements that have been made, for example, by the former chief U.N. arms inspector, Richard Butler, who—his reaction to what Saddam Hussein said in the letter that was sent to the United Nations is: ""But what we really needed to hear is that you can inspect without conditions, that you can go anywhere anytime. The letter,"" he continues, ""did not say that. That is a black hole. That is a significant omission,"" Butler said. ""It is a very snaky letter."" And then Butler added that if inspectors did not have unfettered access to Iraqi facilities, they do not have ""a snowball's chance in hell"" of establishing whether Iraq had nuclear, chemical, or germ weapons. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>""Iraq's basic position is to say that it has no weapons of mass destruction. That is a black lie.""</SPAN> That's what the former head of the U.N. inspectors has said about the most recent developments from Saddam Hussein. <BR><BR>Question: A two-point question if I may. With France and Russia saying that the letter from Iraq is satisfactory, it does seem improbable that the United States will be successful in getting a strong resolution through the Security Council without a veto. So my two-part question is, one, if the inspectors go back into Iraq under the previous rules and the previous resolutions, and they do their work and are able to do an unfettered inspection, one, how will the Bush administration evoke a regime change? And, two, if the inspectors are not allowed to do their work, will the United States go back to the U.N. again or will it take unilateral action at that time? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Well, again, your premise that under the existing inspecting regime, arms inspectors could go back into Iraq and have their work carried out unfettered is not borne out by any of the events of the last decade. There is nothing in Iraq's behavior that would suggest that inspectors going into Iraq under the existing terms could have anything other than opposition, confrontation, inaction, as a result of Iraq's blocking tactics. <BR><BR>And that's why, I think—let me share with you again something that Richard Butler, the United Nations special—excuse me, the UNSCOM executive chairman, said on July 31st of this year in <A href=""http://www.cfr.org/publication/4687/testimony_by_richard_butler_on_iraq_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction.html"">his testimony before Senator Biden and the Foreign Relations Committee</A>. He said, his quote is, <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>""It's essential to recognize that the claim made by Saddam Hussein's representatives that Iraq has no weapons of mass destruction is false. Everyone concerned, from Iraq's neighbors to the United Nations Security Council to the Secretary General of the United Nations, with whom Iraq is currently negotiating on the issue—everyone, simply, Mr. Chairman, is being lied to. From the beginning, Iraq refused to obey the law. Instead, it actively sought to defeat the application of the law in order to preserve its weapons of mass destruction capabilities."" <BR><BR>And he continued: ""Now, I've given this briefest recollection of that history because, Mr. Chairman, I put to you and your colleagues, it shows two things. One, Iraq remains in breach of international law. Two, it has been determined to maintain weapons of mass destruction capability at all costs.""</SPAN> <BR><BR>These are the words of the experts who have a history and experience of personally dealing with the obstacles put up by Iraq. And so that is why the president feels so strongly that anything that is done now must indeed be done differently so that the world can know that disarmament will be carried out. <BR><BR>Question: Ari, a minute ago, in response to Jim's question, I believe you said that any attempts to thwart the inspectors would be—would show that Iraq has something to hide. Is the administration going to view any such attempts as tantamount to a guilty plea by Iraq? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Iraq is already guilty. There are no innocent or guilty pleas remaining for Iraq. Iraq is in possession of weapons of mass destruction, contrary to their promises that they would destroy their weapons of mass destruction. And Iraq, even while the inspectors were in Iraq, sought to develop more weapons of mass destruction. So it's not a question of any further decisions about Iraq's innocence or guilt; Iraq has proven itself guilty to the world.</SPAN>",True,"Iraq, WMD, chemical, biological, nuclear, FS","Saddam Hussein, George W.

If that was true, then why did the United Nations pass 16 of them? <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>The reason is because Iraq has not complied. Iraq said in the speech they are clear of all nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. As we know from the arms inspectors who have been to Iraq, that is categorically a lie.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Iraq also accused President Bush of engaging in lies and falsehoods. And finally, they are already putting up conditions for the weapons inspectors that they said only two days ago they would accept unconditionally. When Iraq talks about sovereignty and independence, history has shown that those are code words for thwarting the inspectors. <BR><BR>Question: Should Iraq have specific concerns about inspections at what they're referring to as presidential sites? What would the administration's position be on that? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Well, on the question of presidential sites, number one, there is no negotiating with Iraq. Iraq has to comply with the terms of the world to disarm, and that is not a matter that is subject to negotiations. On the question of so-called presidential residences, Iraq, by various reports, has some—I've seen some accounts of 17 presidential palaces, some 30 presidential palaces. I don't know very many people who need that many places to live. I don't think he spends much time at all of those places. Something is going on there other than Saddam Hussein sleeping there.

379,2002-09-20,"Deputy Defense Secretary&nbsp;Paul Wolfowitz, Interview With NATO Journalists","<P>Wolfowitz: I guess one last—I think that is obviously crucial in this war on terrorism. I don't want to spend this whole time talking about Iraq, but clearly Iraq is the issue of the hour. In our view, and I really believe it's undeniable, this is part of the war on terrorism. It's not a separate thing. The whole issue of terrorism has to be seen in a different light I think after September 11th. I know many of our European allies say, finally you Americans know what it's like to be a target of terrorism—we've lived with it for decades. <BR><BR>That's precisely the problem. The whole world lived with it for decades. I think the lesson of September 11th is we can't live with it when the scale is 3,000 people killed in a single day, and a foreshadowing of 10,000 or 100,000 or even a million people killed in a mass attack. Therefore the things that we've lived with for the last 20 years have to be viewed in a different way. And while it's important to chase down and capture and kill the terrorists that we can find, and we've had incredible good cooperation among many countries, including all our NATO allies in that respect, we're not going to win this war against terrorism simply by chasing down individual terrorists or by closing the door to particular plots. We're not going to win it on defense. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>We've got to make it clear that support for terrorism in an age of weapons of mass destruction is simply not something that any country can be in the business of, and that's the heart of our issue with Iraq.</SPAN> </P>  <P>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Question: To come back to the smoking gun. How do you make the world safer if you open the door to preemptive action and any state in the world can attack its neighbor if he is frightened by the neighbor, like India attacking Pakistan because it has good reason to feel threatened by Pakistan; Taiwan and China; so on. <BR><BR>Wolfowitz: There is a lot that is unique about the case of Iraq. In the first place there are 16 U.N. Security Council resolutions that distinguish it from every other possible case of this kind. But secondly, what is at the heart of the matter here, and people it seems to me—this is a dot I don't understand why it isn't connected more often, let me put it that way—that it is the combination of those lethal capabilities with active consorting with terrorists and a declared hostility, indeed open threats, that makes it so dangerous. <BR><BR>When weapons of mass destruction can be delivered anonymously through terrorist networks, traditional notions of deterrence don't work. We're in a different world. That's the problem that we're dealing with is we're not talking about some general philosophy of anytime you feel you have a problem you can preempt it militarily. </P>  <P>Question: So it's not a new twist—unique? <BR><BR>Wolfowitz: I think people make too much of new doctrine. There is a new doctrine. I said Iraq is unique in its defiance of the United Nations. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>It is not quite unique, unfortunately, in this combination of having weapons of mass destruction, declared hostility, and connection to terrorist networks.</SPAN> And that is a new problem. It's one that really didn't exist until possibly the end of the last century and we weren't really aware of until September 11th, but I think September 11th has confronted everybody. <BR><BR>This is not just an American problem. This is a worldwide problem. Unless we as a world say here and now that the world's most dangerous weapons can't be put in the hands of the world's most dangerous people—I think that's the phrase the president used some time ago—sooner or later one of us is going to get hit very very hard.

Does the president still believe that there is a link between the two, and what evidence is there to support that? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Well, that's not the immediate question that the president has asked, as he considers what steps are necessary to protect the American people, because he views the threat from Saddam Hussein of being a threat in and of itself, as a result of Saddam Hussein's military activities, his arms buildup, and his history of using those arms. <BR><BR>As for September 11th, what we do is that there are Al Qaeda operating inside of Iraq. But the United States has not gone beyond that. The president believes that what is known about Saddam Hussein, based on his decade of defiance and his arms buildup, is cause enough for the world to need to take action. <BR><BR>Question: One specific question that grows out of it. Vice President [Dick] Cheney, in the course of his speeches, San Antonio and the one that preceded it, and I think Dr. [Condoleezza] Rice have both said at various points that at the end of the Gulf War Saddam was six months to a year from a nuclear weapon. There's nothing in this report to back that up, and in fact at one point the report says that a— <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: One to two years. <BR><BR>Question: —crash program did not appear to have made much progress. Can you tell us where Dr. Rice and Vice President Cheney got that— <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Yes, our information is that—at the time of the Gulf War we believed that Saddam Hussein was three years away from the development of a nuclear weapon. And then based on the assessments we received from the inspectors who were in Iraq, subsequent to that, and on other intelligence information, the conclusion of our community here was that it was six months to 12 months away from development of a weapon. <BR><BR>The point, though, whether it was six months, 12 months, one year or two years, is how close do you want to cut it before Saddam Hussein gets his hands on what he wants? And it's too close right now. The other issue, you always need to ask yourself when you heard that Saddam Hussein is&nbsp;""x"" period of time away from developing a nuclear weapon, at what point did that clock start? It's not as if the six-month or 12-month or one-year clock starts the day a reporter asks somebody in the government the question. The clock could have started three months ago, six months ago, a year ago. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>We don't know. We don't know because inspectors aren't in the country, and because Saddam Hussein is using every means at his disposal to develop his nuclear weapons in the utmost secrecy, because that's what he wants more than anything else.

There was new information in there about Saddam Hussein's efforts to obtain uranium from African nations. That was new information. But on this whole question of new information, this is not about whether or not there is something new.

391,2002-09-25,White House Press Briefing by Ari Fleischer,"Question: We can go back to that in a minute. I have another question. Yesterday in the briefing, you said that the information you have has said Al Qaeda is operating in Iraq. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was asked about linkages between Al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein this morning. He said very definitively that, yes, he believes there are. And then the president said, talking about Al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein, the danger is that they work in concert. Is the president saying that they are working in concert, that there is a relationship? Do you have evidence that supports that? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>No, the president is saying that's the danger. The president has repeatedly said that the worst thing that could happen is for people—the world's worst dictators with the world's worst weapons of mass destruction to work in concert with terrorists such as Al Qaeda, who have shown an ability to attack the United States. And that's what the president has said.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Question: So why—when Rumsfeld was saying, yes, there is a linkage between the two, what is he talking about? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Clearly, Al Qaeda is operating inside Iraq. And the point is, in the shadowy world of terrorism, sometimes there is no precise way to have definitive information until it is too late.</SPAN> And we've seen that in the past. And so the risk is that Al Qaeda operating in Iraq does present a security threat, and it's cause for concern. And I think it's very understandably so. If you're searching, Campbell, again, for the smoking gun, again I say what Secretary Rumsfeld said—the problem with smoking guns is they only smoke after they're fired. <BR><BR>Question: I'm not looking for a smoking gun. I'm just trying to figure out how you make that conclusion, because the British, the Russians, people on the Hill that you all have briefed about all this stuff, say that there isn't a linkage, that they don't believe that Al Qaeda is there working in conjunction in any way with Saddam Hussein. And there is a mountain of comments, both public and private statements that Osama bin Laden has made about Saddam, calling him a bad Muslim, suggesting that there would be no way that the two would ever connect. So I just—if there's something, if you have some evidence that supports this, I'm just wondering why— <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: What supports what I just said is that the president fears that the two can get together. That's what the president has said, and that's one of the reasons that he feels so strongly about the importance of fighting the war on terror.",True,"Iraq, Al Qaeda, FS","Saddam Hussein, George W.

Could you shed any light on either of those, including whether or not these Al Qaeda in Baghdad might be senior Al Qaeda? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: The knowledge that the intelligence community, the shared intelligence information among the coalition members, has of the Al Qaeda relationship with Iraq is evolving.

We know that Al Qaeda have found refuge in Iraq. There is credible reporting that Al Qaeda leaders sought contacts in Iraq to acquire chemical and other weapons of mass destruction capabilities.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Question: But today, the president stopped just short of saying that they were linked. Is there a reason he did that? I mean, are they linked, in his mind? I mean, are they—there are— <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: I'd have to take a look at the verbatim of how the president said it. But we're all saying the same thing: Al Qaeda and Iraq are too close for comfort, in terms of some of these activities that we've talked about. But I want to underscore, the case the President is making about the need for regime change is not directly tied to anything involving Al Qaeda. It's tied to Saddam Hussein's history of developing weapons on his own. The president continues to have fears about what Iraq's activities with Al Qaeda could lead to. But his case is much broader than that. <BR><BR>Question: Well, what are these links that go back a decade? I mean, who are we talking about? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>These are links between Al Qaeda and Baghdad.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Question: But what are the links? I mean— <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Well, Condi— <BR><BR>Question: —has Baghdad supplied Al Qaeda with training, munitions, supplies, whatever, that has allowed them to carry out attacks against the United States? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Well, as Condi said last night—I cite her words—""Iraq has provided some training to Al Qaeda in chemical weapons development.""</SPAN> <BR><BR>Question: But do we know that that expertise has ever been used in a terrorist attack against—not only the U.S., but anybody? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Well, the point is to make certain that it's not. Why is Iraq providing training to terrorists that could put anybody at risk? <BR><BR>Question: Yes, let me come back to the Al Qaeda connection. So, Condi is saying that these contacts go back more than a decade; that they are continual, they are ongoing, they're involved in Baghdad, they're involved in chemical and biological weapons training.

Secondly—and we'll continue to work with members of Congress. But I don't want to get a resolution which ties my hands, a resolution which is weaker than that which was passed out of the Congress in 1998. The Congress in 1998 passed a very strong resolution. They wisely recognized that Saddam Hussein is a threat—was a threat in '98, and he's more of a threat four years later. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>My question is, what's changed? Why would Congress want to weaken a resolution? This guy's had four years to lie, deceive, to arm up. He's had four years to thumb his nose at the world. He is stockpiling more weapons. So I'm not sure why members would like to weaken the resolution.</SPAN> <BR><BR>But we'll work with the members, and I'm confident we can get something done.

He's been doing that for 11 years. For 11 years, he's told the United Nations Security Council, ""Don't worry, I accept your resolution""; then he doesn't follow through. And I'm just not going to accept something that is weak. It is not worth it. It's—the United Nations must show its backbone.

405,2002-10-01,State Department News Briefing by Secretary Colin Powell,"<P>Secretary Powell: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I wanted to say a few words about the developments in Vienna today. Let me begin by saying that let there be no doubt in anyone's mind that the United States will continue to pursue a new U.N. resolution with the Security Council. We believe strongly that we have to keep moving in this direction because, as we have seen in the last several weeks, pressure works, and we have to keep the pressure up. <BR><BR>A new U.N. resolution will give Dr. [Hans] Blix and the UNMOVIC [United Nations Monitoring, Verification, and Inspection Commission] team and the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] the most rigid procedures, the highest standards for Iraq to meet in order to satisfy the international community that they do not have or are not developing weapons of mass destruction and that which they do have can be destroyed by UNMOVIC. We will not be satisfied with Iraqi half-truths or Iraqi compromises or Iraqi efforts to get us back into the same swamp that they took the United Nations into back in 1998. <BR><BR>Pressure works. We're going to keep it up. We're going to work with our partners in the Security Council to put in place a new resolution, a new resolution that also has to have associated with it consequences for failure on the part of the Iraqis to act and to respond to the requirements of the international community. That's what makes this situation different and that's why we need a new resolution, so that we can have consequences associated with failure to perform on the part of the Iraqi government. <BR><BR>We look forward to receiving a briefing from Dr. Blix, as a member of the Security Council, when he briefs the Security Council later this week. Dr. Blix is doing a fine job, but he needs to be in receipt of additional guidance and instructions from the Security Council in the form of new resolution language. And so we will continue to work with our Security Council colleagues to come up with such language in the form of a resolution. </P>  <P>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Question: Mr. Secretary, about ten days ago you said that if the U.N. inspectors prepared to go back without a U.N. resolution, the United States would try to thwart that. Could you elaborate on what you meant by ""thwart"" and does that remain U.S. policy? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: The inspection team, UNMOVIC, is an agent of the Security Council. We are a member of the Security Council. Our position right now is that UNMOVIC cannot simply go back in under the former terms of reference. We can even see today that there were still places that are off-limits, that were not talked about, that were not dealt with. There are still issues in debate. And so we don't want to get into a negotiating situation with the Iraqis under these old terms. That's why we need a new resolution with clear terms, tough terms, high standards, because we are determined to solve this problem once and for all. <BR><BR>And therefore, within the Security Council, I hope we will have discussions over the next couple of weeks—beginning today, frankly, we had discussions in New York today on the elements of a resolution—with different points of view being heard. But I hope that as a result of that process we will come up with strong new instructions for Dr. Blix, and Dr. Blix, as an agent of the Security Council, will carry out what the Security Council instructs him to do. And that's exactly what Dr. Blix has said, and that's what he said in his press conference today and what he told the Iraqis. He was discussing modalities of inspection today, but he also made it clear that he is waiting to see whether or not he gets new instructions from the Security Council. And our position is that he should get such new instructions in the form of a new resolution.</P>",False,"Iraq, WMD","Saddam Hussein, George W.

He called for a congressional resolution that ""sends a clear signal that the country is determined to disarm Iraq and thereby bring peace to the world."" <BR><BR>The proposed language that Bush rejected yesterday was backed by a handful of Republican and Democratic senators prominent in national security matters.

""All of us recognize the military option is not the first choice, but disarming him is.""

His aides, meanwhile, spent much of the day negotiating with proponents of the alternative measure, primarily Senators Joseph R. Biden (D-Delaware) and Richard G. Lugar (R-Indiana). Their version would limit Bush's war-making power to making Hussein disarm, and it would require the president, before using that power, to brief Congress on his efforts to gain United Nations backing. <BR><BR>The Senate debate is likely to center on three approaches to the situation in Iraq:   <UL>  <LI>The Bush plan, which would give the president maximum flexibility to launch military action against Iraq.   <LI>The Biden-Lugar plan, which would require Bush, before taking military action, to inform Congress that he has sought a U.N. resolution of support or that he has determined the Iraqi threat warrants U.S. action unilaterally.   <LI>A plan by Senator Carl Levin (D-Michigan), which would require Bush to win U.N. approval for military action.</LI></UL>",False,"Iraq, WMD","Saddam Hussein, George W.

430,2002-10-04,Important Differences Between Classified National Intelligence Estimate and Unclassified White Paper,"<P>On October 4, 2002, three days after the National Intelligence Council (NIC) published its classified national intelligence estimate (NIE) on ""Iraq's Continuing Programs for Weapons of Mass Destruction,"" the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) published an unclassified paper, ""Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction Programs."" The paper was drafted and ultimately released as a white paper on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs, but the Intelligence Community (IC) intended the paper to also meet requests from Congress for an unclassified version of the classified NIE. <BR><BR>The unclassified paper was substantively similar to, although not nearly as detailed as, the classified NIE. The key judgments were almost identical in layout and substance in both papers. The key judgments of the unclassified paper were missing many of the caveats and some references to alternative agency views that were used in the classified NIE, however. Removing caveats such as ""we judge"" or ""we assess"" changed many sentences in the unclassified paper to statements of fact rather than assessments. For example, the classified NIE said, <BR><BR>""We judge that all key aspects—research and development (R&amp;D), production, and weaponization—of Iraq's offensive biological weapons (BW) program are active and that most elements are larger and more advanced than they were before the Gulf War,"" <BR><BR>While the unclassified paper said, <BR><BR>""All key aspects—research and development (R&amp;D), production, and weaponization—of Iraq's offensive BW program are active and that most elements are larger and more advanced than they were before the Gulf War."" </P>  <P>[text omitted]<BR><BR>There were only two notable differences between the classified NIE and unclassified white paper regarding Iraq's nuclear program. The first, was that the classified NIE included a reference to State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research alternative view on whether Iraq would have a nuclear weapon this decade, which was not included in the white paper. The second centered on the discussion of analysts' assessments of the aluminum tubes. The classified NIE said, <BR><BR>""Most agencies believe that Saddam's personal interest in and Iraq's aggressive attempts to obtain high-strength aluminum tubes for centrifuge rotors—as well as Iraq's attempts to acquire magnets, high-speed balancing machines, and machine tools—provide compelling evidence that Saddam is reconstituting a uranium enrichment effort for Baghdad's nuclear weapons program. (The Department of Energy agrees that reconstitution of the nuclear program is underway but assesses that the tubes are probably not part of the program)."" <BR><BR>The unclassified paper said, <BR><BR>""Iraq's aggressive attempts to obtain high-strength aluminum tubes are of significant concern. All intelligence experts agree that Iraq is seeking nuclear weapons and that these tubes could be used in a centrifuge enrichment program. Most intelligence specialists assess this to be the intended use, but some believe that these tubes are probably intended for conventional weapons programs."" </P>  <P>[text omitted]<BR><BR>The main differences between the biological sections of the classified NIE and the unclassified white paper centered on the removal of the words ""we judge"" from two of the assessments included in the key judgments of both papers. The classified NIE contained the following two assessments: </P>  <UL>  <LI>""We judge that all key aspects—R&amp;D, production, and weaponization—of Iraq's offensive BW program are active and that most elements are larger and more advanced than they were before the Gulf War.""   <LI>""We judge that Iraq has some lethal and incapacitating BW agents and is capable of quickly producing and weaponizing a variety of such agents, including anthrax, for delivery by bombs, missiles, aerial sprayers, and covert operatives.""</LI></UL>  <P>In the unclassified paper the words ""we judge"" were removed from both sentences which changed the assessments to statements of fact. </P>  <P>[text omitted]<BR><BR>The chemical sections of the classified NIE and the unclassified white paper differed in two respects. Again, the caveats or explanations of the IC's uncertainty regarding the WMD programs were removed for the unclassified version. First, the words ""we assess"" were removed from the sentence in the classified NIE, ""We assess that Baghdad has begun renewed production of mustard, sarin, GF (cyclosarin), and VX. . . . "" <BR><BR>The unclassified white paper said, <BR><BR>""Baghdad had begun renewed production of chemical warfare agents, probably including mustard, sarin, cyclosarin, and VX."" <BR><BR>Second, the words ""we have little specific information on Iraq's Chemical weapons (CW) stockpile"" were removed from the classified NIE sentence, <BR><BR>""Although we have little specific information on Iraq's chemical weapons stockpile, Saddam probably has stocked at least 100 metric tons (MT) and possibly as much as 500 MT of CW agents—much of it added in the last year."" </P>  <P>[text omitted]<BR><BR>The classified and unclassified versions of the delivery sections of the NIE differed only in the assessment regarding unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The classified NIE assessed that Iraq was developing a UAV ""probably intended to deliver biological warfare agents,"" but included a footnote which noted, <BR><BR>""The Director, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance, U.S. Air Force, does not agree that Iraq is developing UAVs primarily intended to be delivery platforms for chemical and biological warfare (CBW) agents.

The ADDI said an Iraq nuclear analyst—he could not remember who—raised concerns about the sourcing and some of the facts of the Niger reporting, specifically that the control of the mines in Niger would have made it very difficult to get yellowcake to Iraq. <BR><BR>Both WINPAC [Weapons, Intelligence, Nonproliferation, and Arms Control Center] Iraq nuclear analysts who had followed the Iraq–Niger uranium issue told committee staff they were not involved in coordinating the Cincinnati speech and did not participate in the speech coordination session on October 5, 2002. The WINPAC deputy director for analysis also told [Senate Select Committee on Intelligence] staff he did not recall being involved in the Cincinnati speech, but later clarified his remarks to the committee in writing saying that he remembered participating in the speech, but did not recall commenting on the section of the speech dealing with the Niger information. Committee staff asked the CIA to identify who might have attended the Cincinnati speech coordination meeting and raised concerns with the ADDI about the sourcing and facts of the Niger reporting. The CIA told committee staff that the NESA [Office of Near Eastern and South Asian Analysis] Iraq analyst (name removed from report), believes he may have been the one who attended the meeting and raised concerns about the Niger reporting with the ADDI. <BR><BR>Based on the analyst's comments, the ADDI drafted a memo for the NSC outlining the facts that the CIA believed needed to be changed, and faxed it to the deputy national security adviser and the speech writers. Referring to the sentence on uranium for Africa the CIA said, ""remove the sentence because the amount is in dispute and it is debatable whether it can be acquired from the source. We told Congress the Brits have exaggerated this issue. Finally, the Iraqis already have 550 metric tons of uranium oxide in their inventory."" Later that day, the NSC staff prepared draft seven of the Cincinnati speech which contained the line, ""and the regime has been caught attempting to purchase substantial amounts of uranium oxide from sources in Africa.""

440,2002-10-07,President Bush Outlines Iraqi Threat in Speech at Cincinnati Museum Center,"President Bush: Eleven years ago, as a condition for ending the Persian Gulf War, the Iraqi regime was required to destroy its weapons of mass destruction, to cease all development of such weapons, and to stop all support for terrorist groups. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>The Iraqi regime has violated all of those obligations. It possesses and produces chemical and biological weapons. It is seeking nuclear weapons. It has given shelter and support to terrorism, and practices terror against its own people. </SPAN><BR><BR>While there are many dangers in the world, the threat from Iraq stands alone—because it gathers the most serious dangers of our age in one place. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Iraq's weapons of mass destruction are controlled by a murderous tyrant who has already used chemical weapons to kill thousands of people. </SPAN>This same tyrant has tried to dominate the Middle East, has invaded and brutally occupied a small neighbor, has struck other nations without warning, and holds an unrelenting hostility toward the United States. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>If we know Saddam Hussein has dangerous weapons today—and we do—does it make any sense for the world to wait to confront him as he grows even stronger and develops even more dangerous weapons?</SPAN> <BR><BR>In 1995, after several years of deceit by the Iraqi regime, the head of Iraq's military industries defected. It was then that the regime was forced to admit that it had produced more than 30,000 liters of anthrax and other deadly biological agents. The inspectors, however, concluded that Iraq had likely produced two to four times that amount. This is a massive stockpile of biological weapons that has never been accounted for, and capable of killing millions. We know that the regime has produced thousands of tons of chemical agents, including mustard gas, sarin nerve gas, VX nerve gas. Saddam Hussein also has experience in using chemical weapons. <BR><BR>And surveillance photos reveal that the regime is rebuilding facilities that it had used to produce chemical and biological weapons. Every chemical and biological weapon that Iraq has or makes is a direct violation of the truce that ended the Persian Gulf War in 1991. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Yet, Saddam Hussein has chosen to build and keep these weapons despite international sanctions, U.N. demands, and isolation from the civilized world. </SPAN><BR><BR>Iraq possesses ballistic missiles with a likely range of hundreds of miles—far enough to strike Saudi Arabia, Israel, Turkey, and other nations—in a region where more than 135,000 American civilians and service members live and work. We've also discovered through intelligence that Iraq has a growing fleet of manned and unmanned aerial vehicles that could be used to disperse chemical or biological weapons across broad areas. We're concerned that Iraq is exploring ways of using these UAVS for missions targeting the United States. And, of course, sophisticated delivery systems aren't required for a chemical or biological attack; all that might be required are a small container and one terrorist or Iraqi intelligence operative to deliver it. <BR><BR>And that is the source of our urgent concern about Saddam Hussein's links to international terrorist groups. Over the years, Iraq has provided safe haven to terrorists such as Abu Nidal, whose terror organization carried out more than 90 terrorist attacks in 20 countries that killed or injured nearly 900 people, including 12 Americans. Iraq has also provided safe haven to Abu Abbas, who was responsible for seizing the Achille Lauro and killing an American passenger. And we know that Iraq is continuing to finance terror and gives assistance to groups that use terrorism to undermine Middle East peace. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>We know that Iraq and the Al Qaeda terrorist network share a common enemy—the United States of America. We know that Iraq and Al Qaeda have had high-level contacts that go back a decade.</SPAN> Some Al Qaeda leaders who fled Afghanistan went to Iraq. These include one very senior Al Qaeda leader who received medical treatment in Baghdad this year, and who has been associated with planning for chemical and biological attacks. We've learned that Iraq has trained Al Qaeda members in bomb-making and poisons and deadly gases. And we know that after September the 11th, Saddam Hussein's regime gleefully celebrated the terrorist attacks on America. <BR><BR>Many people have asked how close Saddam Hussein is to developing a nuclear weapon. Well, we don't know exactly, and that's the problem. Before the Gulf War, the best intelligence indicated that Iraq was eight to ten years away from developing a nuclear weapon. After the war, international inspectors learned that the regime has been much closer—the regime in Iraq would likely have possessed a nuclear weapon no later than 1993. The inspectors discovered that Iraq had an advanced nuclear weapons development program, had a design for a workable nuclear weapon, and was pursuing several different methods of enriching uranium for a bomb. <BR><BR>Before being barred from Iraq in 1998, the International Atomic Energy Agency dismantled extensive nuclear weapons-related facilities, including three uranium enrichment sites. That same year, information from a high-ranking Iraqi nuclear engineer who had defected revealed that despite his public promises, Saddam Hussein had ordered his nuclear program to continue. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>The evidence indicates that Iraq is reconstituting its nuclear weapons program.</SPAN> Saddam Hussein has held numerous meetings with Iraqi nuclear scientists, a group he calls his ""nuclear mujahideen""—his nuclear holy warriors. Satellite photographs reveal that Iraq is rebuilding facilities at sites that have been part of its nuclear program in the past. Iraq has attempted to purchase high-strength aluminum tubes and other equipment needed for gas centrifuges, which are used to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons. <BR><BR>The world has tried limited military strikes to destroy Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capabilities—only to see them openly rebuilt, while the regime again denies they even exist. <BR><BR>After eleven years during which we have tried containment, sanctions, inspections, even selected military action, the end result is that Saddam Hussein still has chemical and biological weapons and is increasing his capabilities to make more. And he is moving ever closer to developing a nuclear weapon. <BR><BR>The attacks of September the 11th showed our country that vast oceans no longer protect us from danger. Before that tragic date, we had only hints of Al Qaeda's plans and designs. Today in Iraq, we see a threat whose outlines are far more clearly defined, and whose consequences could be far more deadly.

It changed things dramatically. <BR><BR>Question: Are you comfortable with the intelligence you're getting out of Iraq as far as weapons of mass destruction, leadership targets, those sorts of things? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: I don't know any user of intelligence that's ever satisfied.

One wants perfect visibility into everything including minds, people's minds, as well as things that aren't even observable because they're underground and are not known completely. No one's ever satisfied with intelligence. </P>  <P>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Question: I'd like to take you back to the scenarios that many administrations have talked about this week of a post-Hussein Iraq. You've talked in some of your comments and testimony, if Saddam were taken out, go into exile, if under some circumstance there were to be a coup, I guess I'm wondering what would be the Administration's reaction, your opinion, if there were to be a military coup that deposed Saddam, but not necessarily end up with a regime that can meet the criteria that has been laid out by yourself and other senior administration officials? Would you still hold that regime — <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: First of all, what I think isn't—it's what the president and the country and the other coalition partners would make judgments about all of that. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>It seems to me that the way to answer your question without me answering it, but you can answer it yourself, is that if you think of what the president said, he has said repeatedly the task is to disarm that country and for them not to be a threat to their neighbors. So the short answer to your question is, I would think, that anything that changed the regime from one thug to another and didn't disarm the country would obviously not have met the test.</SPAN> If Saddam Hussein were to wake up in the morning and decide to prefer to live elsewhere and he took with him his family and his regime, the small number of associates who have obviously been involved with his repression and development of these programs and left and a different regime was there that did not want weapons of mass destruction and did not want to invade its neighbors, did not want to have relationships with terrorist networks, that obviously would change the scene dramatically.</P>",True,"Iraq, WMD, chemical, biological, nuclear, FS","Saddam Hussein, George W.

There are other threats to our country with which we must deal. And that means—and one place is Iraq. I want to—let me share with you some thoughts, a serious, serious, subject. It's one that's got a lot of folks debating in the coffee shops or in the homes about Iraq. I want to remind you of a couple of things. <BR><BR>First of all, 11 years ago this leader of Iraq, the dictator of Iraq, made a pledge that he would not have weapons of mass destruction, he promised the world after he got whipped that he wouldn't have weapons of mass destruction. And the Security Council of the United Nations passed a resolution which said, you wont have weapons of mass destruction. Since that time, he has lied, he has deceived, he has not listened to the U.N. Security Council resolutions. Since that time we now recognize as a country that oceans no longer protect us like they used to. A new reality set in, in America. It used to be we could kind of sit back and look at a threat from afar and say, well, that may affect somebody else, but it doesn't affect us. <BR><BR>Prior to September the 11th, we had the comfort of realizing or looking back in history and saying that we're pretty safe here in America. Others may be threatened—after all, he attacked two in his neighborhood, he gassed his own people—but not us. September the 11th changed the equation, changed our thinking. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>It also changed our thinking when we began to realize that one of the most dangerous things that can happen in the modern era is for a deceiving dictator who has gassed his own people, who has weapons of mass destruction to team up with an organization like Al Qaeda.</SPAN> <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>As I said—I was a little more diplomatic in my speech, but we need to—we need to think about Saddam Hussein using Al Qaeda to do his dirty work, to not leave fingerprints behind.</SPAN> I went to the United Nations. I did so because I wanted to challenge that body. Sixteen resolutions, sixteen defiances. They passed resolution after resolution after resolution, and 16 times Saddam Hussein has defied those resolutions. For the sake of keeping peace, it's important that there be an international body that has backbone, that can work to keep the peace in this new era we're in. And now is the time for choice. The United Nations can decide whether it's the League of Nations or whether or not it is a United Nations capable of keeping the peace. (Applause.) <BR><BR>There is universal agreement that Saddam Hussein poses a serious threat. He's a threat to the neighborhood, he's a threat to our allies. There is universal understanding that right after the Gulf War he was close to having a nuclear weapon. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>He still wants to have a nuclear weapon. For the sake of peace, for the sake of our security, now is the time to make sure that Saddam says what he said he would do. He must disarm. It's his choice to make. He said he would disarm.

If Saddam Hussein is a danger and a support to terrorists and an encouragement to terrorist regimes, conversely his demise will open opportunities for governments and institutions to emerge in the Muslim world that are respectful of fundamental human dignity and freedom and that abhor the killing of innocents as an instrument of national policy. <BR><BR>Some ask, why act now? Why not wait until the threat is imminent? <BR><BR>In some ways the answer is very simple. As Senator Joseph Lieberman put it recently, ""I have felt for more than a decade now,"" the Senator said, ""that every additional day that Saddam Hussein is in power in Iraq is an additional day of danger for the Iraqi people, for his neighbors in the region, particularly for the people and military of the United States and indeed for the people of the world."" <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Indeed, the more time passes the more time Saddam Hussein has to develop his deadly weapons and to acquire more.</SPAN> The more time he has to plant sleeper agents in the United States and other friendly countries or to supply deadly weapons to terrorists he can then disown, the greater the danger. <BR><BR>The notion that we can wait until the threat is imminent assumes that we will know when it is imminent.

Secondly, there are a number of people in the room today who have devoted a lot of their time and efforts to helping North Korean refugees get out of North Korea in hopes of bringing down the regime. If you have any comment on that, would be very interesting to hear. <BR><BR>Mr. Wolfowitz: Well, first of all, as the president said, more importantly than I, <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>there clearly are some common characteristics between the Iraqi regime and the North Korean regime, and, for that matter, the Iranian regime. And the common characteristics have to do with possessing or developing weapons of mass destruction and consorting with terrorists.</SPAN> Of course, there are also differences. And among those differences are the degree of relationship between particular terrorist groups—that's clearly one thing we look at—the level of clearly expressed animosity to the United States. To the best of my knowledge, Saddam Hussein is the only world leader who openly glorified the attacks of September 11th. And if you look at some of the magazine covers that appeared in Baghdad—and there's no free press in Baghdad, need I point out—on the anniversary of September 11th, it's really chilling.

469,2002-10-20,Secretary of State Colin Powell on <EM>Fox News Sunday</EM>,"Brit Hume: I'm sorry, just one question. It comes down to this: We believe that the one resolution you now feel confident you will get, specifying inspections and consequences, would be sufficient for the president to act, and you have no objection if there are further resolutions? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: I can't object because I don't know what further resolutions might be. But the resolution I hope will come out of the Security Council will lay out the indictment, will put in place a new, tough, take-it-or-leave-it inspection regime for Saddam Hussein, and will make it clear that consequences will flow from continued violation. How those consequences will flow remains to be seen with respect to the United States and other like-minded nations who, in the presence of continued violations on the part of the Iraqis, believe they will have all the authority necessary if they decide to act, whether other members of the body choose to act with us at that time remains to be seen. <BR><BR>Mr. Snow: All right, let's run through this quickly, then. Completely open inspections, no conditions. That's an absolute must. <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: Yes. <BR><BR>Mr. Snow: Secondly, there are going to be timetables. <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: Yes. <BR><BR>Mr. Snow: And how soon must Iraq (a) provide a full accounting of what it has and (b) permit unconditional searches? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: Tony, I would rather that come out of the negotiation process with the Security Council members this week, rather than me prejudge what they might decide. <BR><BR>Mr. Snow: Also, is it your view that the U.N. Charter, if Iraq is found in ""material breach"" of previous resolutions, already grants you the authority to use force, and that is the reason why you don't need a second resolution? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: I think that argument can be made, and we'll be making that argument with our friends. In fact, Iraq has been in violation of these many resolutions for a period of 11 years. And the president, acting in his authority as commander-in-chief, and consistent with the United Nations Charter, and especially empowered by the congressional resolution last week that says work with the United Nations, try to get a tough resolution, and you can operate within the United Nations framework if military action is required and it is approved by the United Nations; but, if the United Nations, the Security Council, in the presence of violations, is not willing to then authorize military force, you, Mr. President, have the authority you need under our constitutional [sic] and in accordance with our laws, and under self-defense aspects of the U.N. Charter, to take military action with like-minded nations. <BR><BR>So if it comes to military action, it could be done one of two ways: the United States, with like-minded nations, taking it—and we believe all the authority that is necessary for us to do so—or with all other nations as part of a U.N. resolution. <BR><BR>Mr. Snow: On that thing, let me double back quickly to North Korea. Why is Kim Jong-il less of a threat than Saddam Hussein? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: Kim Jong-il is a threat in his own right, and I don't think we have to compare him to Saddam Hussein, and it's not a good comparison anyway. Saddam Hussein, in recent years, has invaded two of his neighbors. He has used these kinds of weapons of mass destruction against his own people as well as his neighbors. He has resources available to him. It's a very wealthy little country. They've misspent their wealth, but it is a very wealthy little country. <BR><BR>And Korea is an isolated country with no wealth, with a broken economy, a broken society, desperately in need, and with neighbors who are not going to be happy with this new development. <BR><BR>And so there are different ways to approach North Korea, but it is dangerous and Iraq is dangerous.",False,"Axis of Evil, WMD, Iraq","George W.

470,2002-10-20,Secretary of State Colin Powell on NBC's <EM>Meet the Press</EM>,"Mr. Tim Russert: You also said five weeks ago that any resolution or resolutions will say that Saddam Hussein is in breach of his commitments not to develop weapons of mass destruction; that inspectors must return with complete unfettered access; and third—let me show you your exact words—""I believe a third element of any resolution, resolutions, combination of resolutions, has to be what the U.N. will do, what the international community will do, if he does not act in the way that has been demanded by the United Nations."" <BR><BR>Will, in fact, that be included in the resolution? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: We will see what ultimately comes out of the United Nations, but I stand by that statement. I believe, first of all, any resolution must document the fact that he's in violation of these many U.N. resolutions over the years. Secondly, the resolution must contain a strong new inspection regime so he can't defeat it the way he did the previous one. And I think such a resolution must also talk about the fact that consequences lay ahead. <BR><BR>Now, where the debate has been is how those consequences get determined, and I am confident that any resolution we come up with will in no way affect the president's authority with other like-minded nations to act in the presence of continued Iraqi violation. The debate is how do you get all of the members of the Security Council to act in unison. And that's where we're having the discussion. There are 15 sovereign nations in the Security Council and each has a right to express its opinion. <BR><BR>But I believe we'll be successful in the indictment, a tough inspection regime, and a linkage to consequences. <BR><BR>Mr. Russert: If Saddam does not allow the inspectors complete unfettered access, the United States will take military action alone if necessary without U.N. approval? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: If Saddam once again frustrates the inspection regime and makes it clear that he is not going to cooperate, I think that is a matter of the utmost gravity. And the president has said clearly that if in that instance the United Nations will not act, then the United States, with other like-minded nations, will act. And the resolution that's under consideration would in no way affect the president's ability to do that in a negative way, if that's what he chooses to do at the time. <BR><BR>Mr. Russert: Some who support the Iraqi position of allow us more time, give us inspections, are saying, ""Mr. United States, you're saying to us in Iraq, 'Give us complete unfettered access. And guess what? Even if you do, there's going to be a regime change.'"" <BR><BR>I asked you when you were on a month ago, could you have disarmament without regime change? You told the <EM>USA Today</EM> that is it perhaps possible that if Saddam Hussein disarmed completely he could stay in power. True? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>What I said was that if Saddam disarmed entirely and satisfied the international community, that, in effect, would be a change in attitude and a change in the way the regime is looking at its situation in the world, and it was consistent with what the President has said previously and subsequently.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Mr. Russert: So he can save himself, in effect, and remain in power— <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>All we are interested in is getting rid of those weapons of mass destruction. We think the Iraqi people would be a lot better off with a different leader, a different regime, but the principal offense here are weapons of mass destruction, and that's what this resolution is working on.</SPAN> There are many other resolutions that he has violated, with respect to human rights, with respect to threatening his neighbors, with respect to return of prisoners. All of those, I think, have to be dealt with in due course. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>But the major issue before us is disarmament.</SPAN> And remember where regime change came from. It came out of the previous administration; it came out of the Congress in 1998 when it was thought the only way to get rid of weapons of mass destruction was to change the regime. And we will see whether they are going to cooperate or not. <BR><BR>The issue right now is not even how tough an inspection regime it is or isn't. The question is will Saddam and the Iraqi regime cooperate, really, really cooperate and let the inspectors do their job. If the inspectors do their job and we can satisfy the world community that they are disarmed, that's one path. If we can't satisfy the world community that they are disarmed, that takes us down another path. <BR><BR>Mr. Russert: Do Vice President Cheney and Secretary of Defense [Donald] Rumsfeld share your view that you can have disarmament without regime change? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: The president has made it clear what the United States position is.",True,"Iraq, WMD, FS","Colin Powell, Richard B.

471,2002-10-20,Secretary of State Colin Powell on ABC's <EM>This Week</EM>,"Mr. George Stephanopoulos: There was also some concern on Capitol Hill this week about what they weren't told. A lot of Members of Congress were concerned that the United States kept the information about North Korea secret because they didn't want to complicate the Iraq vote. And I want to show a quote from Represent [sic]Chaka Fattah of Pennsylvania. He said, ""The beauty of the White House misleading people is that it's difficult to change our policy now that he has the vote in hand."" How do you respond to that? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: I'm sorry, it's nonsense. We saw the intelligence in early July. We challenged the intelligence community to get us as much as they had so we made sure we had a solid case. We looked at the information through July and August. I began consultations at a very high level with some of our friends, and in early September we began to brief members of Congress about what we knew about North Korean enriched uranium activity that was inconsistent with the agreed framework. We briefed both sides, Democrats and Republicans. We briefed both houses. <BR><BR>Mr. Stephanopoulos: But a very small number, not the Senate majority leader. <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: We briefed enough people so that there was no secret about it. And I can provide to anyone who would care to see it in the Congress the list of the briefings that were offered and that were conducted. Some members were unable to take the briefings and we briefed their staffers. <BR><BR>And then after Assistant Secretary [James] Kelly went to North Korea and came back with the information that they admitted it, we began another round of briefings, not only from the State Department, from the CIA, to pass on this new information. Now, because this is a relatively recent development, we didn't get around to every constituency within the Congress, but it is simply not correct to say that the United States was not making Congress aware of the fact that North Korea had begun to enrich uranium. <BR><BR>Mr. Stephanopoulos: But aren't the situations of North Korea and Iraq similar enough that ever member of Congress deserved to have this information before they voted on Iraq? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: I don't think it was relevant to the vote on Iraq. It never entered our calculation that the manner in which we were briefing Congress had anything to do with the vote on Iraq. I think, in fact, it might even have reinforced the vote on Iraq. I mean, I can't understand the logic that says we held this back because it would have made it harder to get the votes we needed on Iraq. I think it might have told everybody that this is dangerous and we need to make sure we're firm with Iraq as a signal to North Korea. <BR><BR>But the suggestion that this is some kind of plot on the part of the administration is just false. And there were so many members of Congress briefed that I cannot believe a member can go around saying that the administration was not forthcoming. And last night when this issue came up, I challenged my staff to get me everything you had, and I've got two and a half pages of briefings. <BR><BR>Mr. Stephanopoulos: On Iraq, do you expect to get a U.N. Security Council resolution this week? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: I expect early this week to put down a full resolution after we've had some very useful conversations with a number of our permanent Security Council member colleagues. And I hope that now the conversation will be joined not only with the permanent members but with the elected members, all 15 members. <BR><BR>Whether they can get to a final solution this week or not, I don't know. There are still some difficult issues. It isn't just going to be here it is and that's it. <BR><BR>Mr. Stephanopoulos: Has the United States dropped its requirement that there be an explicit authorization of force in the first U.N. resolution? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: The president has all the authorization he needs if he believes it is necessary to use force to defend the American people. <BR><BR>Mr. Stephanopoulos: That sounds like a yes. <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: Any resolution that comes out of the United Nations, I am sure will contain an indictment against Iraq, which we asked for, will contain a new tough inspection regime and it will make clear that Iraq will face consequences if they frustrate and violate this new inspection regime. <BR><BR>Then the question becomes, and the debate we've been having, is at that point if Iraq fails once again to comply, what are the consequences. The United States believes that it and like-minded nations might have all the authority, will have all the authority it needs at that point, if it chooses to take action. If other members wish to meet again to discuss it, that's up to other members, but the president believes he now has the authority. And with a new resolution with continued violation on the part of the Iraqis, the president has authority, as do other like-minded nations, just as we did in Kosovo. <BR><BR>Mr. Stephanopoulos: So do you believe that U.N. inspectors will be in Iraq before the end of the year? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: I can't predict that. It depends upon, one, getting a strong resolution, but it depends even more on whether Iraq is willing to cooperate this time. If Iraq is willing to cooperate, then the inspectors can get their job done. If Iraq chooses to keep frustrating, denying, deceiving, distracting, fooling around with the inspectors, then the inspectors are not going to be able to get their job and they're going to come home. They're not going to be jerked around the way they were in 1997 and 1998. And that's clear. We've made that clear to our Security Council colleagues. We cannot go down that road again. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Either Iraq cooperates and we get this disarmament done through peaceful means or they do not cooperate and we will use other means to get the job done. </SPAN><BR><BR>Mr. Stephanopoulos: There are some new pictures out of Iraq this morning. It looks like Saddam Hussein is trying to bolster his popularity. He is opening up—and we're showing them right now—opening up the prisons, allowing all prisoners, he says, out of Iraqi jails. What do you make of that? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: I make of it that they better watch out where the next door is; it puts them right back in jail. I mean, this is typical of this man's use of human beings for these political purposes of his. Now, do you really think if these people are dangerous to the regime that they're going to be allowed out and stay out? Or are they going to be back in jail in about three days' time?

It would be foolhardy to do that. Conditions are different, circumstances are different, and your methods are different. <BR><BR>The president put it very well when he said there may be many modalities, but there's only one morality. And the morality is that we are not prepared to allow nuclear powers of this kind to grow up. <BR><BR>North Korea is a country that is sitting there on the Korean peninsula, I have to remind people often that it is deterred by 37,000 American forces and a strong alliance with the Republic of Korea that has kept the peace for 50 years. <BR><BR>It is also a poor and isolated power that we believe, in perhaps trying to break out, if it wants to break out of that isolation, can be told very bluntly that it cannot break out of that isolation at the same time that it pursues illegal nuclear weapons. <BR><BR>Iraq, we've tried everything. We've been down many, many roads with Iraq over 11 years. Iraq has also, in the last 20 years, aggressively attacked its neighbors. It has aggressively tried to assassinate a former American president. It sits in the Middle East with a homicidal dictator there who has used weapons of mass destruction, chemical weapons, against his own people and against his neighbors. <BR><BR>And so these are not comparable situations. They're dangerous, both of them dangerous. But we believe that we have different methods that will work in North Korea that clearly have not and will not work in Iraq. <BR><BR>Blitzer: So basically what I hear you saying is you've tried the diplomacy over years with the Iraqis, it hasn't worked, that's why you're threatening war right now. <BR><BR>Rice: Well, it's even worse than that. We defeated Iraq in a war, and Iraq signed on to a whole list of obligations in order to get a cease-fire, a cease-fire that was put there not by the United States but by the U.N. coalition. And then Iraq has systematically, year after year after year, defied those obligations. That cannot continue. </P>  <P>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Blitzer: Are you close to getting a new U.N. Security Council resolution, working with the French and the Russians and other members, that would allow the inspectors to go back into Iraq? <BR><BR>Rice: Oh, we're making progress. The diplomacy has been intense, and we expect that some time early this week, we'll probably table a resolution, so that all members of the Security Council can consider it. <BR><BR>We are very clear that this is a resolution that must state that there should be consequences, that must state that the Iraqis are in breach of their obligations, that has to have an inspections regime that this time has a chance. <BR><BR>And this is not inspections for inspections' sake. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>The goal here is to disarm Saddam Hussein.</SPAN> And in order to do that, we are going to have to test his willingness to cooperate this time around. He can always defeat, as he has before, an inspections regime if he's not prepared to cooperate. This is a country the size of France. He can hide things. <BR><BR>So what we've got to test is his willingness to cooperate. And the world is going to have to have a zero-tolerance view if he is unwilling to cooperate this time. We cannot get back into cat–and–mouse games where he holds these people up for two hours here, and then six hours later he lets them in, after he's destroyed documents. We can't do that this time. This time it has to be a test of his willingness to disarm, because if he is not willing to disarm, then the world is going to have to disarm him. <BR><BR>Blitzer: And so, basically, what you're saying, if the inspectors go back in, as you hope they will, they have to get complete, unrestricted access, and if there's any violation of that whatsoever, the inspectors leave, and then the U.S. goes to war? <BR><BR>Rice: It's the U.S. view, and I would hope it's the world's view, is that, after 11 years of defiance, after 11 years in which he's completely thumbed his nose at his obligations, and after four years in which he's had a chance to be outside of the watchful eye of inspections and monitoring, we can't afford to get back into cat-and- mouse games with the Iraqis. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>This time, either we disarm him, or he disarms himself by cooperating, or we're going to have to disarm him.</SPAN></P>",True,"WMD, Iraq, Axis of Evil, chemical, FS","Condoleezza Rice, George W.

481,2002-10-24,A CIA Rival: Pentagon Sets Up Intelligence Unit,"Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and his senior advisers have assigned a small intelligence unit to search for information on Iraq's hostile intentions or links to terrorists that the nation's spy agencies may have overlooked, Pentagon officials said today. Some officials say the creation of the team reflects frustration on the part of Mr. Rumsfeld, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz and other senior officials that they are not receiving undiluted information on the capacities of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq and his suspected ties to terrorist organizations. But officials who disagree say the top civilian policy makers are intent on politicizing intelligence to fit their hawkish views on Iraq. In particular, many in the intelligence agencies disagree that Mr. Hussein can be directly linked to Osama bin Laden and his network, Al Qaeda, or that the two are likely to make common cause against the United States. In addition, the view among even some senior intelligence analysts at the Central Intelligence Agency is that Mr. Hussein is contained and is unlikely to unleash weapons of mass destruction unless he is attacked. But Mr. Rumsfeld's inner circle of advisers view Mr. Hussein's record, which includes aggression against Kuwait and the use of poison gas against his people, as much more alarming, and they are not willing to risk leaving him in power. They cite numerous intelligence findings indicating links between the Iraq and senior Al Qaeda leaders. The four-–to five–person intelligence team was established by Douglas J. Feith, the under secretary of defense for policy and another strong advocate for military action against Mr. Hussein. It was formed not long after the Sept. 11 attacks to take on special assignments in the global war on terror.              <br /><br />              The team's specialty is using powerful computers and new software to scan and sort documents and reports from the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency and other intelligence agencies. The team's current task, described by one official as ""data mining,"" is to glean individual details that may collectively point to Iraq's wider connections to terrorism, but which may have been obscured by formal assessments that play down the overall Iraqi threat.",False,"chemical, biological, nuclear, WMD, Al Qaeda, Iraq","George W.

In an effort to nudge the talks forward, the United States formally introduced its resolution to the full membership of the 15-nation Security Council.

Now the world must insist that that judgment be enforced. Iraq's obligation to disarm is not new, or even recent. To end the Persian Gulf War and ensure its own survival, Iraq's regime agreed to disarm in April of 1991. For over a decade the Iraqi regime has treated its own pledge with contempt. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>As today's resolution states, Iraq is already in material breach of past U.N. demands. Iraq has aggressively pursued weapons of mass destruction, even while inspectors were inside the country. Iraq has undermined the effectiveness of weapons inspectors with ploys, delays, and threats—making their work impossible and leading to four years of no inspections at all. <BR><BR>The world has learned from this experience an essential lesson, inspections will not result in a disarmed Iraq unless the Iraqi regime fully cooperates. Inspectors do not have the power to disarm an unwilling regime. They can only confirm that a government has decided to disarm itself. History has shown that when Iraq's leaders stall inspections and impede the progress, it means they have something to hide. <BR><BR>The resolution approved today presents the Iraqi regime with a test—a final test. Iraq must now, without delay or negotiations, fully disarm; welcome full inspections, welcome full inspections, and fundamentally change the approach it has taken for more than a decade.</SPAN> <BR><BR>The regime must allow immediate and unrestricted access to every site, every document, and every person identified by inspectors. Iraq can be certain that the old game of cheat-and-retreat tolerated at other times will no longer be tolerated. <BR><BR>Any act of delay or defiance will be an additional breach of Iraq's international obligations, and a clear signal that the Iraqi regime has once again abandoned the path of voluntary compliance. <BR><BR>With the passage of this resolution, the world must not lapse into unproductive debates over whether specific instances of Iraqi noncompliance are serious. Any Iraqi noncompliance is serious, because such bad faith will show that Iraq has no intention of disarming. If we're to avert war, all nations must continue to pressure Saddam Hussein to accept this resolution and to comply with its obligations and his obligations. <BR><BR>America will be making only one determination: is Iraq meeting the terms of the Security Council resolution or not?

That is why confronting the threat posed by Iraq is not a distraction from the war on terror. It is absolutely crucial to winning the war on terror. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Saddam Hussein is harboring terrorists and the instruments of terror. He is pressing forward with weapons of mass destruction—weapons he's already used in his war against Iran and against his own people. His regime has had high-level contacts with Al Qaeda going back a decade and has provided training to Al Qaeda terrorists.</SPAN> And as the president has said, ""Iraq could decide on any given day to provide biological or chemical weapons to a terrorist group or to individual terrorists"" —which is why the war on terror will not be won till Iraq is completely and verifiably deprived of weapons of mass destruction. (Applause.) <BR><BR>The government of the United States understands that just as World War II was waged in both Europe and the Pacific, the war on terror must be waged on many fronts at once.

You've mentioned underground places. You've also said that the inspectors don't have the wherewithal to find it, if it's well hidden unless somebody gives it up. Do you—without saying what you would do with any evidence or what decisions the president might make, does the United States have the evidence to know when Iraq presents its declaration this weekend, will you be able to look at that and tell whether they're telling the truth and being forthcoming?

Never have, never did, never will."" They could move over on the spectrum and say, ""You're right. We used to. And all the stuff the U.N. said we had when they came in here and found it and started destroying it all, that's all we ever had. It's all been destroyed."" That's the second option. The third option, they could come in and say, ""Yeah, we used to have it, and almost all of it was destroyed.

If the responsibility is on Iraq to demonstrate that it does not have weapons of mass destruction under the U.N. resolution, it is not for some country to go in and give them a clean bill of health, it is for Iraq to give itself a clean bill of health by saying, ""Here's honestly what we currently have.

We've got to be wise about how we view the world and make sure that the new arrangements, the new alliances aren't allowed to develop. An alliance, for example, where a nation that has weapons of mass destruction uses a shadowy terrorist network as a forward army, perhaps encouraging them to attack America without leaving any fingerprints. You've got to worry about disrupting training facilities. <BR><BR>And that's why I started talking about Iraq and Saddam Hussein. Not only starting a debate in the halls of the United States Congress, which overwhelmingly supported any means necessary to deal with the threat to the United States, but also took the debate to the United Nations, and a couple of weeks ago to NATO. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>It's important for our fellow Americans to understand that, when we're talking about Saddam Hussein, we're talking about a man who said he has had no weapons of mass destruction, yet we believe has weapons of mass destruction</SPAN>—a man who has not only had weapons of mass destruction, but he's used weapons of mass destruction. He used weapons of mass destruction on his neighbors and he used weapons of mass destruction on his own citizens. He's a man who has professed hate to America, as well as our friends and allies.

544,2002-12-05,White House Press Briefing by Ari Fleischer,"Question: Ari, when Tariq Aziz of Iraq says that his country possesses no weapons of mass destruction, how do we know that he's not telling the truth? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Well, Iraq has lied before and they're lying now about whether they possess weapons of mass destruction.</SPAN> Tariq Aziz's statement is very much like statements that Iraq made throughout the 90s, denying that they had weapons of mass destruction when, of course, it was found that they indeed had weapons of mass destruction. And so I see little reason to believe Iraq now when they have such a history of lying in the past about this very topic. <BR><BR>Question: Well, I mean, you're saying, I don't see why, if they were lying in the past they wouldn't be lying now, but do you have anything that constitutes proof? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Let me cite for you something I think you will find constructive. This is July 31, 2002, Senator Biden's committee up on Capitol Hill, and this is a statement by Richard Butler, formerly of the United Nations. Quote—this is Richard Butler speaking— ""It is essential to recognize that the claim made by Saddam's representative that Iraq has no weapons of mass destruction is false. Everyone concerned, from Iraq's neighbors to the U.N. Security Council to the Secretary of the U.N., with whom Iraq is currently negotiating on this issue—everyone simply, Mr. Chairman, is being lied to."" <BR><BR>And Mr. Butler, formerly of the U.N., continued, ""From the beginning, Iraq refused to obey the law. Instead it actively sought to defeat the application of the law in order to preserve its weapons of mass destruction capabilities."" <BR><BR>Two more paragraphs— ""The work of UNSCOM [United Nations Special Commission], the body created by the United Nations Security Council to take away Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, had various degrees of success—varying degrees,"" said Mr. Butler. ""But above all, it was not permitted to finish the job. Almost four years have now passed since Iraq terminated UNSCOM's work, and in that period, Iraq has been free of any inspection and monitoring of its WMD [weapons of mass destruction] programs."" <BR><BR>And then Mr. Butler concluded, ""This shows two key things. One, Iraq remains in breach of international law, and two, it has been determined to maintain a weapons of mass destruction capability at all costs."" <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>President Bush has said Iraq has weapons of mass destruction; [British Prime Minister] Tony Blair has said Iraq has weapons of mass destruction; [Secretary of Defense] Donald Rumsfeld has said Iraq has weapons of mass destruction; Richard Butler has said they do; the United Nations has said they do; the experts have said they do.

At the White House, President Bush's spokesman, Ari Fleischer, dismissed Iraq's claims that it possesses no nuclear weapons, citing the testimony of past weapons inspectors and intelligence experts.

However, Washington's demands are likely to bring to a head a simmering quarrel with the U.N. weapons inspectors over how they should do their job, in what will be seen by U.S. critics as an attempt to hijack the inspections process.

This strategy is integral to the National Security Strategy of the United States of America and the National Strategy for Homeland Security. We will not permit the world's most dangerous regimes and terrorists to threaten our nation and our friends and allies with the world's most destructive weapons. <BR><BR>Weapons of mass destruction pose a grave danger. They could allow America's adversaries to inflict massive harm against our country, our military forces abroad, and our friends and allies. Some rogue states, including several that support terrorism, already possess WMD and are seeking even greater capabilities, as tools of coercion. For them, these are weapons of choice intended to deter us from responding to their aggression against our friends in vital regions of interest. For terrorists, WMD would provide the ability to kill large numbers of our people without warning. They would give them the power to murder without conscience on a scale to match their hatred for our country and our values. <BR><BR>Our national strategy to combat WMD is based on three pillars. We will pursue robust counter-proliferation policies and capabilities to deter and defend against the use of these weapons. We will strengthen nonproliferation measures to prevent states and terrorists from acquiring WMD. We will increase our preparations to respond effectively to any use of WMD against us or our friends and allies. To succeed, we must use new technologies, strengthen our intelligence capabilities, work even more closely with allies, and establish new partnerships with other key states, including former adversaries. <BR><BR>The need to prevent, deter, defend against, and respond to WMD threats presents our nation with a difficult and complex challenge.

The official's comments are a clear sign that the administration anticipates the interview process will spark a direct confrontation with Iraq. Several senior officials have made clear in recent days that they see the interviews—with scientists and technicians who have worked in past and present Iraqi weapons and missile programs—as the quickest way to declare Baghdad in material breach of the new resolution without going through a lengthy inspections process that may ultimately be inconclusive. Under the resolution, once an Iraqi material breach, or violation of its terms, is declared, the U.N. Security Council is to convene to consider ""serious consequences,"" including the possible use of military force, against Hussein's government. The senior official said a breach could be declared not only on the basis of information scientists might provide but also if Hussein refuses to make available anyone the inspectors want to interrogate. ""Let's say we, that UNMOVIC has a witness list that it wants to interview outside the country. It really is the obligation of the Iraqi government to produce them if they are going to come clean,"" the official said. UNMOVIC is the U.N.

560,2002-12-19,"Secretary of State Colin Powell, Press Conference on Iraq Declaration","Resolution 1441 required Iraq to submit a declaration on all its mass weapons program of destruction, a declaration that was ""currently accurate, full and complete,"" in the words of the resolution. <BR><BR>The inspectors told the Security Council this morning that the declaration fails to answer many open questions. They said that in some cases they even have information that directly contradicts Iraq's account. <BR><BR>Our experts have also examined the Iraqi document. The declaration's title echoes the language of Resolution 1441. It is called, ""Currently Accurate, Full and Complete Declaration."" But our experts have found it to be anything but currently accurate, full or complete. The Iraqi declaration may use the language of Resolution 1441, but it totally fails to meet the resolution's requirements. <BR><BR>The inspectors said that Iraq has failed to provide new information. We agree. Indeed, thousands of the document's pages are merely a resubmission of material it gave the United Nations years ago, material that the U.N. has already determined was incomplete. <BR><BR>Other sections of the Iraqi declaration consists of long passages copied from reports written by the United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency. The only changes the Iraqi regime made were to remove references critical to its own conduct. The declaration totally fails to address what we had learned about Iraq's prohibited weapons programs before the inspectors were effectively forced out in 1998. <BR><BR>And let me just touch on a few examples, and we'll be giving out a fact sheet later with additional examples. <BR><BR>Before the inspectors were forced to leave Iraq, they concluded that Iraq could have produced 26,000 liters of anthrax. That is three times the amount Iraq had declared. Yet, the Iraqi declaration is silent on this stockpile, which, alone, would be enough to kill several million people. <BR><BR>The regime also admitted that it had manufactured 19,180 liters of a biological agent called botchulinum toxin. U.N. inspectors later determined that the Iraqis could have produced 38,360 additional liters. However, once again, the Iraqi declaration is silent on these missing supplies. <BR><BR>The Iraqi declaration also says nothing about the uncounted, unaccounted precursors from which Iraq could have produced up to 500 tons of mustard gas, sarin gas and VX nerve gas. <BR><BR>Nor does the declaration address questions that have arisen since the inspectors left in 1998. For example, we know that in the late 1990s, Iraq built mobile biological weapons production units. Yet, the declaration tries to waive this away, mentioning only mobile refrigeration vehicles and food-testing laboratories. <BR><BR>We also know that Iraq has tried to obtain high-strength aluminum tubes which can be used to enrich uranium in centrifuges for a nuclear weapons program. The Iraqi regime is required by Resolution 1441 to report those attempts. Iraq, however, has failed to provide adequate information about the procurement and use of these tubes. <BR><BR>Most brazenly of all, the Iraqi declaration denies the existence of any prohibited weapons programs at all. The United States, the United Nations and the world waited for this declaration from Iraq. But Iraq's response is a catalogue of recycled information and flagrant omissions. It should be obvious that the pattern of systematic holes and gaps in Iraq's declaration is not the result of accidents or editing oversights or technical mistakes. These are material omissions that, in our view, constitute another material breach. <BR><BR>We are disappointed, but we are not deceived. This declaration is consistent with the Iraqi regime's past practices. We have seen this game again and again—an attempt to sow confusion and buy time, hoping the world will lose interest. This time, the game is not working. This time, the international community is concentrating its attention and increasing its resolve as the true nature of the Iraqi regime is revealed again.",False,"Iraq, WMD, chemical, biological, nuclear","Saddam Hussein, Colin Powell, George W.

580,2003-01-07,Defense Department News Briefing by Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and General Richard Myers,"<P>Question: With all these stepped-up deployments to the Gulf, does that essentially make war with Iraq inevitable? </P>  <P>Rumsfeld: No. The situation is as I've described it and as the president has described it. He went to the United Nations, and he has—because of the emphasis that he has put on this problem, and the Congress and the United Nations in a unanimous U.N. Security Council resolution have put on this problem, we are seeing that Iraq is allowing inspectors in and behaving in a manner that's somewhat different from that which it's been behaving in over the preceding years. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>The president is determined to see what takes place, and he's determined to see that Iraq disarms.</SPAN> He prefers that they do so peacefully. And what we need to do as a Department of Defense is to see that we continue, with our friends and allies around the world, to take appropriate steps so that the president will have the options that he may or may not decide to use. And his conclusion is, is that the last choice is the use of military force, not the first choice; and that is why he's preceding as he's preceding. </P>  <P>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Question: Mr. Secretary, does the United States have current evidence that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction, or is it just a strong suspicion? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: The president has stated what he has stated. The Central Intelligence Agency has stated publicly, as well as in classified sessions, their conclusions. And their conclusions have tended to be, over a period of time, A, that we do not have evidence that they have nuclear weapons; we do have evidence that they have had a nuclear program that was robust; and that they were very skilled in denial and deception. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>With respect to chemical weapons, we know they not only have had them but that they've used them. And with respect to biological weapons, we have clearly—the Central Intelligence Agency has said what it has said, and there's no doubt in my mind but that they currently have chemical and biological weapons.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Question: Well, is there—do you have evidence that they currently have them, or are you just basing it on the fact that they had them? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: It—I do not think that if it were the latter, the president would be saying what he's saying or the director of Central Intelligence would be saying what he's saying. <BR><BR>Question: Well, if at some point—if the president should decide that war is necessary, is it your expectation that he would lay before the Security Council or lay before the public hard evidence that justified that decision? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: The—I don't know what his decision will be. The—first of all, I don't know if he'll decide that force is needed at all. And if it were to be needed, I think he would probably make a calculation as to the advantages that would accrue from revealing intelligence information and the disadvantages that would result from doing so, because to the extent that prior to using force, he were to reveal intelligence information in a way that damaged the ability to conduct the conflict, it would be, needless to say, unfortunately, risky for the coalition forces' lives engaged. <BR><BR>And I don't know what calibration would be made there. On the one hand, you have the advantage of persuading the publics in the world and countries of the facts of the matter, and on the other hand, you have—by so doing, you weaken your ability to do that which you have decided to do. So I can't speak for what the president will decide.&nbsp;</P>  <P>[text omitted]&nbsp;<BR><BR>Question: Getting back to weapons of mass destruction, it stretches it yet to find any evidence of chemical/biological weapons, or any nuclear program. And I'm just wondering how difficult you think it would be to put together a coalition absent any hard evidence? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: The—since the president's presentation to Congress and to the United Nations, countries across the globe have been coming forward and discussing with us ways that they can be helpful. A growing number have offered to be helpful in the event the president—the situation evolves and it looks as though Iraq will not disarm peacefully; they've offered to be helpful regardless of any other thing that may occur. Still others have said that they want to be helpful and would be able to be helpful if there is additional action by the United Nations of some sort. Still others have come forward and said they would like to be helpful in a coalition effort after hostilities ceased and Saddam Hussein's government was in the process—and the government of Iraq—a different government, presumably—was in the process of disarming. And those numbers in each of those categories have been growing every week. <BR><BR>Question: But again, the inspectors have yet to find any evidence of any program; isn't that right? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: If you'll recall our discussion about inspections, inspections are designed not to find anything and not to discover anything. That's not why they went in. They're—they went in not in a discovery process but to inspect. And the presumption is that the country has decided to voluntarily disgorge all of its information and cooperate. And the fact of the matter is, as you're aware from the comments coming out of the U.N. inspectors, that there is an impression that the declaration was deficient. There's—without me getting into intelligence information or my personal view, all you have to do is listen to what the secretary of State and the inspectors and others in the United Nations Security Council are saying about what's taking place. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>And I don't think that anyone could reasonably characterize it as a country that has decided to cooperate and voluntarily disarm itself of any chemical, biological or nuclear capabilities.</SPAN></P>",True,"Iraq, WMD, nuclear, FS","Saddam Hussein, Donald Rumsfeld, Richard B.

Here's what we do know to date. The chemical warheads found by the inspectors were not—not—on the declared list that Iraq provided to the world indicating what weapons it said it possessed. The fact that Iraq is in possession of undeclared chemical warheads, which the United Nations says are in excellent condition, is and of itself a serious and troubling matter. <BR><BR>Question: Ari, how did you determine that the canisters are not in the declaration? Did somebody go through the whole 12,000 pages — <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Went back and looked through the declaration, and I think it is an easy matter to review. If somebody wants to make the contention that the 12 chemical warheads discovered at this facility, this late '90s-constructed bunker just outside Baghdad is in the declaration, the burden is on them to show what page it's on and to cite the reference. <BR><BR>The United States government has very thoroughly—and we're familiar with the declaration—gone through it very, very carefully to see whether or not the existence of these 12 warheads at this bunker was in the declaration. It was not. And I think also it's fair to say if it had been in the declaration, there's not a person in this room who wouldn't have known it because you would have remembered it, because it would have been a very significant declaration that they are indeed in possession today of chemical warheads. They kept saying they were not. <BR><BR>Question: So does this constitute the smoking gun, Ari? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: It's troubling and it's serious, is exactly as I've characterized it. The president is continuing to work with our allies, consulting with our allies. The inspectors' efforts remain underway. More information about this very discovery needs to be carried out—needs to be obtained. The inspectors are doing their job, and we'll see what the rest of their job entails in terms of what knowledge is gained from the additional information that we are all seeking about these warheads. <BR><BR>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Question: So at this point, you're going to wait for the 27th before the next round of discussions before the Security Council about Iraq compliance? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Well, I think what we will continue to look for is whether or not Saddam Hussein is disarming. And obviously, <A href=""http://www.un.org/Depts/unmovic/new/documents/baghdad_press_briefings/january/U.N.MOVIC%20IAEA%20Press%20Statement%2016%20Jan%2003.pdf"">the discovery of 12 chemical warheads</A> is proof that he has not disarmed, especially when you consider the fact that, for the purpose of letting the world know whether he had disarmed, he filed a declaration saying that he did not have weapons. He also filed a declaration that did not include these 12 warheads at the bunker. And now we know, of course, that he has them. <BR><BR>Question: There's a wire report that Secretary [Colin] Powell is telling a German paper that by the end of the month it will be proven that Iraq is not cooperating. Does the U.S. have some plan to lay out some evidence before the end of the month? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Well, as I indicated, the president and members of his administration will continue to talk to the public about this matter. There's no question Saddam Hussein has not cooperated, and I can cite for you some of the statements that were made by Dr. [Hans] Blix, for example: We feel Iraq must do more than they have done so far in order to make this a credible avenue—the message we want to bring to Baghdad is the situation is very tense and very dangerous, and everybody wants to see a verified and credible disarmament of Iraq. That's when he added, we feel Iraq must do more than they have done so far to make this a credible avenue. I think it's fair to say that the inspectors are finding increased examples of Iraqi failure to comply. <BR><BR>Question: Ari, the president, in the days leading up to the adoption of that resolution, spoke in very clear language. He said that this was Saddam Hussein's final chance, that it had to be a full and complete and accurate accounting, and that there would be no deceptions and no games, zero tolerance. You say, in the case of these warheads, he filed a declaration, they were not in there. Unless you see a complete change of heart before that January 27th deadline, is the president prepared to tell his representatives at the United Nations to say, game over? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Number one, nobody has called that a deadline, January 27th is an important reporting date. And the president has indeed said that Iraq is entering its final phase. And the president has said time is running out. It's not my place to put words in the president's mouth saying if there's a timetable attached to that. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>I think Saddam Hussein needs to get the very clear understanding and message from the United States and from the world that he needs to disarm, that this is indeed serious. The timetable for it, Saddam Hussein needs to figure that out. He needs to disarm immediately, and he promised he would do so in the declaration. And as yesterday's discovery shows, what he filed in the declaration is not met by the facts on the ground.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Question: Assuming that you're right and Iraq is wrong about whether these warheads were disclosed in the declaration, does the fact that Iraq has undeclared warheads, chemical warheads, put them in material breach of any U.N. resolutions? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: As for picking a legal word, <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>the president's approach to this is that the issue is that Saddam Hussein is not disarming.</SPAN> That is what is most relevant. Per the United Nations and the use of the word ""material breach,"" according to Resolution 1441, when it was passed, Iraq was and continues to be in material breach. When they filed their declaration that at the time the United States declared failed to have all information in it which, of course, has now been verifiably demonstrated to be an accurate statement, as if there would have been a doubt, we said at that time that they continue to be in material breach. Certainly, the discovery of the chemical warheads in Iraq does not get Iraq out of the material breach they're currently in. <BR><BR>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Question: Ari, in the last few months, everything has been about Iraq and North Korea to a great extent. Is there any—and some people have been complaining, what's happened to the war on terror? Do you see this as all part of the war on terror, or do you think the focus has shifted a little bit? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: There's no question the president views what's happening in Iraq as a portion of the war on terror. There's no question about it. And the president views this as all areas where, as the president has said many times, <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>the biggest threat that we face is a nation like Iraq teaming up with terrorists to provide them with weapons of mass destruction.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Question: First of all, a follow-up to Elizabeth's question. Without regard to what may or may not have been passed to the inspectors in the way of intelligence, did the United States, anybody in the United States government, have any advance knowledge of the warheads that we discovered yesterday before they were discovered by the inspectors? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: I'm not in a position to give you an answer to that. You're asking me to speak for the entire United States government. <BR><BR>Question: To your knowledge. <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: To my knowledge, no. The inspectors worked at the inspectors' discretion. But I really am not in a reliable position to give you that type of information about the entire United States government. And, again, I am not going to pass on information to you about intelligence conveyance. <BR><BR>Question: I'm not asking that. I'm asking, basically, did this come as a surprise to the White House? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Again, I'm not aware of—the people that I spoke to immediately about it, that they had any advance information about it.

(End of Video Clip) <BR><BR>Snow: Does this mean that as of now, the United States has no physical or documentary evidence that Saddam is producing weapons of mass destruction? </P>  <P>Rumsfeld: No. What it means is that the inspections are designed to allow a cooperative country to show what they have. And the idea that inspectors can go in there and discover things, and find things, if they were be that, they would have been named ""finders"" or ""discoverers"" instead of ""inspectors."" We know what a proper inspection regime looks like. Kazakhstan opened up. South Africa opened up. Other countries—Ukraine opened up, and inspectors went in and said, ""Yes, that's what's there."" The Iraqis clearly—they filed a false declaration. They have not allowed—submitted the names of the scientists that they have been asked to submit.

It's an enormous country. <BR><BR>Snow: Okay. The reason I ask — <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: What—what we have is—is a lot of intelligence from our country, from other countries, <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>that leads the United States intelligence community to say that they have a biological weapons program, a chemical weapons program, and weapons, and that they have a—they assess they do not have nuclear weapons but that they do have an active nuclear weapon program.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Snow: Around the country, we're increasingly hearing—and I'm hearing it from conservatives, I'm even hearing it from some military people—some concern that when it comes to presenting a case to the American people, the president does not now have the goods, in the sense of saying ""He's building this kind of weapon here."" Do we have the kind of evidence—for instance, when John Kennedy was talking about the Cuban Missile Crisis, we had the satellite photos—do we have hard evidence of that sort that will be sufficiently persuasive that Americans will say, ""All right, let's go""? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: What we have is a great deal of information about what they have bought and what they have, a good deal of information about their systematic efforts to try to deceive and deny us the ability to know precisely where things are. They have been dispersing things throughout the country, hiding them under ground. They've been taking documentation and distributing it in private homes and the like. People don't do that if—unless they're trying to hide what they're doing. <BR><BR>Snow: So, the case we have right now is a connect-the-dots case.

A quick question everybody in the country, people around the world, want to know: Will there be a war with Iraq? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: We're still hoping for a peaceful solution, but it is up to Saddam Hussein and Iraq to make that decision. Dr. Blix and Dr. El Baradei are in Baghdad today. I hope they will make it clear to Saddam Hussein that he is running out of time, he has got to cooperate; <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>moreover, he has got to disarm and he has got to do it in a way that the inspectors don't have to go hunt-and-peck looking for things, but that Iraq comes forward and meets the will of the international community that it must disarm of its weapons of mass destruction. If they do that, there is still a chance for a peaceful solution.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Mr. Blitzer: How much time do the Iraqis have? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: Well, we'll see. I think time is running out. We can't keep this up forever. And we'll all look forward to receiving the report from Dr. Blix and Dr. El Baradei next Monday, the 27th of January, at the United Nations. And after that, the Security Council will have an opportunity to make its judgment as to what should happen next, and the president of the United States will also make his judgment as to what he thinks should happen next. <BR><BR>Mr. Blitzer: Well, you're quoted as saying earlier in the week, you said, ""We believe a persuasive case will be there at the end of the month that Iraq is not cooperating."" <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: I think there is a persuasive case there now. Iraq has given us a false declaration in December, still has not accounted for stocks of various biological and chemical agents that we know they had. And there is a discrepancy between what they had and what they are now reporting they have, and they have not solved those discrepancies. And we simply can't walk away from that kind of discrepancy. <BR><BR>So there is a case now. And we will see how strong that case looks when Dr. Blix and Dr. El Baradei report, but I think it's fairly persuasive that they are not cooperating, and I hope they understand as a result of the visit of the two chief inspectors today that time is running out on them. <BR><BR>Mr. Blitzer: It's one thing not to cooperate. It's another thing to find a smoking gun. The inspectors say so far they have not found a smoking gun. Is not cooperating enough of a smoking gun, if you will, to justify war? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: That will be a matter for the Council to decide, and the president will make his own decision. But, you know, look at what we have found. We have found false declarations. There are all sorts of toxic agents that are unaccounted for. And then this week, the inspectors found chemical rockets. Now, those rockets are not just laying benignly around. What are they doing there? Why— <BR><BR>Mr. Blitzer: But they were— <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: What difference does it make? The point is that they are designed for a unique purpose, and that is to carry a chemical agent. And so they should have been declared. They should have been destroyed. This is the kind of weapon that Iraq says it no longer has, and yet there it is. <BR><BR>Now, whether that constitutes one person's smoking gun or some other person's smoking gun, <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>I think it contributes to a body of evidence that suggests Iraq is not disarming and is not cooperating with efforts of the United Nations inspectors to get them to disarm.</SPAN> And that's what we're looking for, and I hope that message comes through clearly today when they meet with the Iraqi officials. <BR><BR>Mr. Blitzer: Well, the Iraqis say it was simply a slip, they made a mistake.",True,"Iraq, WMD, chemical, biological, nuclear, FS","Saddam Hussein, George W.

We cannot expect inspectors, in a place that is a completely totalitarian regime, closed, where they've become very, very clever at means of deception, to necessarily walk in and find a weapon. The Iraqi regime has had four years with no inspections in the country to hide its programs in a country the size of Iraq, under tremendous totalitarian means. <BR><BR>Now, we have to remember that even the weapons inspectors are saying they are not getting active cooperation from the Iraqis. What they're getting is cooperation, as they say, on process, not on substance, opening up warehouses where they know there's nothing because they've already removed it, and what the inspectors have to do is to count on the cooperation of the Iraqis. Resolution 1441 set up a test for the Iraqis. After 12 years of deception, was the Iraqi regime ready to disarm? Was it ready to comply? Was it ready to fully cooperate? We are not seeing compliance. We know what that looks like. It looks like what South Africa did when it decided that it wanted to get rid of its nuclear weapons programs. It invited people into the country. It showed people where those weapons programs are. <BR><BR>Instead, with Iraq, we are getting signals to scientists not to talk to the weapons inspectors without a minder there. Who are we kidding? What scientist is going to talk to an inspector with an Iraqi official there? We are finding documents in the houses, undeclared sites, the houses of Iraqi scientists. We're finding chemical weapons shells sitting around that the Iraqis just somehow forgot. And a lot is at stake. When Hans Blix says that he cannot account for various weapons programs and various elements of the weapons program, we're talking about thousands of anthrax, liters of anthrax. We're talking about botulism toxin. We're talking about ricin. We're talking about VX and mustard gas. There is an enormous amount at stake here, and time is running out.

609,2003-01-21,White House Press Briefing by Ari Fleischer,"<P>Question: But isn't there a distinction between the strength of the United Nations as a body and its willingness to go along with the United States? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Well, I think this is one of the issues that will be tested here. And it's not just the United States, there are many nations around the world. But clearly, if the United Nations had continued on the path that it had been on, there would still be no inspectors inside Iraq. And so I think the process that has begun here is a process where the president has been working through multilateral channels, where the president made the decision to work with the United Nations to try to achieve the goal of disarmament to protect the peace. <BR><BR>But if the '90s were any guide, the United Nations needed President Bush to come along and give it the spine that was required to at long last get the inspectors back into Iraq so that peace could have one final chance. </P>  <P>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Well, this document was not billed as that Saddam Hussein poses an immediate threat. That's the case that is made in a variety of ways. What this document goes through at great length is the fact that Saddam Hussein has lied, is lying, and will lie. And one of the areas that he does that is through exploitation of Islam. <BR><BR>I think one of the points that is made here is that Saddam Hussein deny's pilgrims in Iraq the right to make the Hadj to Saudi Arabia, yet he professes to be a man of faith. It is one of the most central tenets of Islam to allow people to travel to Saudi Arabia for the Hadj.</P>  <P>[text omitted] </P>  <P>Question: Ari, the president says that Saddam's pursuit of weapons of mass destruction is a threat to the United States and to its allies. Are there any plans or any intentions from Iraq to use those weapons of mass destruction to either strike the United States or its allies? Is there any proof of that? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Any proof of it? I think the best guide is history. The best guide is what Saddam Hussein has done in the past, where he has attacked his neighbors. And I remind you also, under Saddam Hussein's obligations to the world, he is prohibited from having, for example, ballistic missiles with a range in excess of 150 kilometers. And so he is prohibited from even having the means to engage in these attacks. <BR><BR>The fear is, however, as Secretary [Richard] Armitage pointed out very vividly today, Saddam Hussein in the late '90s was found by the United Nations to be in possession of long-range missiles, to be in possession of anthrax, mustard gas, VX gas, sarin, botulin. The question is, what has Saddam Hussein done with the very weapon systems prohibited to him that the United Nations said he has. Where are they? What has he done with them? <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>He certainly has not provided the world with any proof that he has destroyed them, leading to the conclusion that, of course, he still has them.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Question: But, Ari, you're saying that there's no U.S. intelligence to show that he has any intention of using these weapons against the United States? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: I didn't say that. <BR><BR>Question: Is there? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: I don't discuss intelligence information as a matter of routine. <BR><BR>Question: So are there any indications or plans that Saddam Hussein, beyond having a nuclear—weapons of mass destruction, would have any intention of using them against the United States? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Again, I think his intention is best judged by his past.

He can't stand America and what we stand for. He can't stand our friends and allies. He's a dangerous, dangerous man with dangerous, dangerous weapons. And that's why the world came together at the United Nations Security Council and said, Mr. Saddam Hussein must disarm. The message was as clear as can possibly be delivered—Mr. Saddam Hussein must disarm. He's a dangerous man, with dangerous weapons. He's a danger to America, and our friends and allies. And that's why the world has said, disarm.</SPAN> <BR><BR>And the first step of that disarmament was for him to make a declaration of his weapons—12,000 pages of deceit and deception were placed at the U.N. Security Council. We know what it means to disarm; we know what a disarmed regime does. We know how a disarmed regime accounts for weapons of mass destruction. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Saddam Hussein is not disarming, like the world has told him he must do. <BR><BR>He's a dangerous man, with dangerous weapons. He's a danger to America, and our friends and allies. And that's why the world has said, disarm.</SPAN> <BR><BR>But Saddam Hussein has learned lessons from the past. See, the first time he was told to disarm was 11 years ago. He is adept at deception and delays and denying. He asked for more time so he can give the so-called inspectors more runaround. He's interested in playing hide and seek in a huge country. He's not interested in disarming. <BR><BR>I hope the world has learned the lessons from the past, just like Saddam Hussein has learned the lessons from the past, but in a different way. It's time for us to hold the world to account, and for Saddam to be held to account. We must not—(applause.) We must not be fooled by the ways of the past. After all, we just discovered undeclared chemical warheads in Iraq. It's incredibly troubling and disturbing for a man—that is evidence of a man not disarming. <BR><BR>He wants to play a game. For the sake of peace, we must not let him play a game. And so the resolutions of the Security Council will be enforced. (Applause.) <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>My hope is that Saddam Hussein will disarm voluntarily; that's my hope. I take seriously the commitment of any troop into combat. I desire peace.

Should any Iraqi officer or soldier receive an order from Saddam Hussein, or his sons, or any of the killers who occupy the high levels of their government, my advice is, don't follow that order.

614,2003-01-23,"Deputy&nbsp;Defense Secretary&nbsp;Paul Wolfowitz, Speech on Iraq Disarmament","<P>As terrible as the attacks of September 11th were, however, we now know that the terrorists are plotting still more and greater catastrophes. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>We know they are seeking more terrible weapons—chemical, biological, and even nuclear weapons. In the hands of terrorists, what we often call weapons of mass destruction would more accurately be called weapons of mass terror. The threat posed by the connection between terrorist networks and states that possess these weapons of mass terror presents us with the danger of a catastrophe that could be orders of magnitude worse than September 11th. Iraq's weapons of mass terror and the terror networks to which the Iraqi regime are linked are not two separate themes—not two separate threats. They are part of the same threat. Disarming Iraq and the war on terror are not merely related. Disarming Iraq of its chemical and biological weapons and dismantling its nuclear weapons program is a crucial part of winning the war on terror. Iraq has had 12 years now to disarm, as it agreed to do at the conclusion of the Gulf War. But, so far, it has treated disarmament like a game of hide and seek—or, as Secretary of State Powell has termed it, ""rope-a-dope in the desert.""</SPAN>&nbsp;</P>  <P>[text omitted]&nbsp;<BR><BR>In Iraq's case, unfortunately, the situation is the opposite. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1441 gave Saddam Hussein one last chance to choose a path of cooperative disarmament, one that he was obliged to take and agreed to take 12 years ago. We were under no illusions that the Baghdad regime had undergone the fundamental change of heart that underpinned the successes I just mentioned. Nevertheless, there is still the hope—if Saddam is faced with a serious enough threat that he would otherwise be disarmed forcibly and removed from power—there is still the hope that he might decide to adopt a fundamentally different course. But time is running out. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>The United States entered this process hopeful that it could eliminate the threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass terror without having to resort to force.</SPAN> And we've put more than just our hopes into this process. Last fall, the Security Council requested member states to give, quote, ""full support,"" unquote, to U.N. inspectors. </P>  <P>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Let's consider for a moment what inspectors can do and what they can't. As the case of South Africa and the other success stories demonstrate, inspection teams can do a great deal to verify the dismantling of a program if they are working with a cooperative government that wants to prove to the world it has disarmed. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>It is not the job of inspectors to disarm Iraq; it is Iraq's job to disarm itself. What inspectors can do is confirm that a country has willingly disarmed and provided verifiable evidence that it has done so.</SPAN> If a government is unwilling to disarm itself, it is unreasonable to expect the inspectors to do it for them. They cannot be charged with a ""search and destroy"" mission to uncover so-called smoking guns, especially not if the host government is intent on hiding them and impeding the inspectors' every move. Inspectors cannot verify the destruction of weapons materials if there are no credible records of their disposition. <BR><BR>Think about it for a moment. When an auditor discovers discrepancies in the books, it is not the auditor's obligation to prove where the embezzler has stashed his money. It is up to the person or institution being audited to explain the discrepancy. It is quite unreasonable to expect a few hundred inspectors to search every potential hiding place in a country the size of France, even if nothing were being moved. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>And, of course, there is every reason to believe that things are being moved constantly and hidden. The whole purpose, if you think about it, for Iraq constructing mobile units to produce biological weapons could only have been to be able to hide them. We know about that capability from defectors and other sources, but unless Iraq comes clean about what it has, we cannot expect the inspectors to find them. <BR><BR>Nor is it the inspectors' role to find Saddam's hidden weapons when he lies about them and conceals them.</SPAN> That would make them not inspectors, but detectives, charged with going through that vast country, climbing through tunnels and searching private homes. Sending a few hundred inspectors to search an area the size of the state of California would be to send them on a fool's errand or to play a game. And let me repeat: this is not a game. <BR><BR>David Kay, a former chief UNSCOM [United Nations Special Commission] inspector, has said that confirming a country's voluntary disarmament is a job that should not take months or years. With cooperation, it would be relatively simple because the real indicators of disarmament are readily apparent. They start with the willingness of the regime to be disarmed, the commitments communicated by its leaders, the disclosure of the full scope of work on weapons of mass destruction, and verifiable records of dismantling and destruction. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Unfortunately, though not surprisingly, we have seen none of these indications of willing disarmament from Iraq.</SPAN> <BR><BR>So let's discuss what disarmament does not look like. Despite our skepticism about the intentions of the Baghdad regime, we entered the disarmament process in good faith. Iraq has done anything but that. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Instead of a high-level commitment to disarmament, Iraq has a high-level commitment to concealing its weapons of mass terror.</SPAN> Instead of charging national institutions with the responsibility to dismantle programs, key Iraqi organizations operate a concealment effort that targets inspectors and thwarts their efforts. Instead of the full cooperation and transparency that is evident in each of those disarmament success stories, Iraq has started the process by openly defying the requirement of Resolution 1441, and I quote, ""to provide a currently accurate, full and complete"" declaration of all of its programs. <BR><BR>Indeed, with its December 7th declaration, Iraq resumed a familiar process of deception. Secretary Powell has called that 12,200-page document a catalogue of recycled information and brazen omissions that the secretary said, ""totally fails to meet the resolution's requirements. Most brazenly of all""—I'm still quoting Powell—""the Iraqi declaration denies the existence of any prohibited weapons programs at all,"" unquote. Among those omissions are large quantities of anthrax and other deadly biological agents and nuclear-related items that the U.N. Special Commission concluded Iraq had not accounted for. There are also gaps in accounting for such deadly items as 1.5 tons of the nerve gas VX, 550 mustard-filled artillery shells, and 400 biological weapons-capable aerial bombs that the U.N. Special Commission concluded in 1999—and this is the U.N.'s conclusion—Iraq had failed to account for. </P>  <P>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Today, those practices continue, except that over the last 12 years, Iraqi preparations for concealing their illegal programs have become more extensive and sophisticated. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Iraq's national policy is not to disarm but rather to hide its weapons of mass terror.</SPAN> That effort, significantly—the effort of concealment—is led by none other than Saddam's own son, Qusay, who uses a Special Security Organization under his control for that purpose. Other security organizations contribute to these ""anti-inspection"" activities, including the National Monitoring Directorate, whose ostensible purpose is to facilitate inspections. Instead, it provides tip-offs of sites that are about to be inspected and uses ""minders"" to intimidate witnesses. Iraqi security organizations and a number of government agencies provide thousands of personnel to hide documents and materials from inspectors, to sanitize inspection sites and to monitor the inspectors' activities. Indeed, the ""anti-inspectors"" vastly outnumber the couple of hundred of U.N. personnel on the ground in Iraq. <BR><BR>Already, we have multiple reports and other evidence of intensified efforts to hide documents in places where they are unlikely to be found, such as private homes of low-level officials and universities. We have reports and other evidence of prohibited material and documents being relocated to agricultural areas and private homes or hidden beneath mosques and hospitals. Furthermore, according to these reports, the material is moved constantly, making it difficult to trace or find without absolutely fresh intelligence. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>It is a shell game played on a grand scale with deadly serious weapons.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Those efforts at concealment are assisted by active surveillance and penetration of the inspectors. In the past, Iraq systematically used its intelligence capabilities to support efforts to conceal its illegal activities. Former inspector David Kay recalled that in 1991, the inspectors came across a document warning the chief security official of the facility they were about to inspect, that David Kay would lead the U.N. team. That warning had been issued less than 48 hours after the decision had been made for Kay to lead the team, and at that time, fewer than 10 people within the inspection organization were supposed to know the operational plan. </P>  <P>[text omitted]<BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>If Iraq were to choose to comply with the requirement to dismantle its weapons of mass terror, we would know it.</SPAN> We would know it from their full and complete declaration of everything that we know that they have, as well as by revelations of programs that our intelligence has probably not yet discovered. Recall that after the Gulf War, we were stunned by the magnitude of Iraq's nuclear program, despite all of our intelligence efforts and those of our allies, including Israel, and even though Iraq had been subject to IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency]&nbsp;inspections for many years. <BR><BR>We would know it if we saw an attitude on the part of the Iraqi government that encouraged people to cooperate with inspectors, rather than intimidated them into silence and lies. We would know it when inspectors were able to go about their work without being spied on or penetrated. And we would know it most of all when Iraqi scientists and others familiar with the program were clearly speaking freely. <BR><BR>But in the absence of full cooperation, particularly in the absence of full disclosure of what Iraq has actually done, <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>we cannot expect that the U.N. inspectors have the capacity to disarm an uncooperative Iraq,</SPAN> even with the full support of American intelligence and the intelligence of other nations. <BR><BR>American intelligence capabilities are extraordinary, but they are far from the omniscient, all-seeing eye depicted in some Hollywood movies. For a great body of what we need to know, we are dependent on traditional methods of intelligence—that is to say, human beings, who either deliberately or inadvertently are communicating to us. </P>  <P>[text omitted]<BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>So, we come back to the imperative: Baghdad must disarm, peacefully if at all possible, but by force if necessary. The decision on whether Iraq's weapons of mass terror will be dismantled voluntarily or whether it will have to be done by force is not up to us, it is not up to the inspectors, it is not up to the United Nations. The decision rests entirely with Saddam Hussein. So far, he has not made the fundamental decision to disarm, and unless he does, the threat posed by his weapons programs will remain with us, and, indeed, it will grow. <BR><BR>Yes, there are real dangers in confronting a tyrant who has and uses weapons of mass terror and has links to terrorists.</SPAN> But those dangers will only grow. They are far greater now than they would have been five or 10 years ago, and they will be much greater still five or 10 years from now. President Bush has brought the world to an extraordinary consensus and focus on this problem; it is time to see it resolved, voluntarily or by force, but resolved one way or another.

Let's start with a question being asked in every world capital: Is war with Iraq inevitable? <BR><BR>Feith: I think the disarmament of Iraq is inevitable. President Bush has said that Iraq must disarm itself of its weapons of mass destruction—the chemical weapons that it has, the biological weapons that it has, and the nuclear weapons program that it has along with its long-range missiles. It must do that either through cooperation with the U.N. or the United States will lead a coalition of willing countries to bring about the disarmament of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. <BR><BR>Question: But is there a change in the rules of the game? i.e., are the conditions of Iraqi compliance changing? The inspectors have entered Iraq, and we're now talking about different examples, like South Africa, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine. Those countries said, ""We have programs for weapons of mass destruction. Come and disassemble them."" Iraq is saying, ""I don't have a nuclear weapons program or a program for weapons of mass destruction. Washington is the one who insists on making this accusation. How can I prove this accusation false?"" <BR><BR>Feith: The world community knows that Iraq has chemical weapons and biological weapons. It also knows that Iraq has been pursuing for decades nuclear weapons. The entire apparatus that was created for inspecting Iraq through the recent Security Council Resolution 1441 was created so that if the Iraqi government would finally decide, because of all the international pressure, that it must disarm, then this inspection apparatus would be available to help the Iraqi government demonstrate to the world that it was disarming cooperatively.",False,"Iraq, WMD, chemical, biological, nuclear","Saddam Hussein, George W.

Let me try to explain why we feel so strongly about Iraq and why we are determined that the current situation cannot be allowed to continue. We are where we are today with Iraq because <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Saddam Hussein and his regime have repeatedly violated the trust of the United Nations, his people, and his neighbors, to such an extent as to pose a grave danger to international peace and security. <BR><BR>The United Nations Security Council recognized this situation and unanimously passed Resolution 1441, giving Iraq one last chance to disarm peacefully after 11 years of defying the world community.</SPAN> Today, not a single nation, not one, trusts Saddam and his regime. And those who know him best trust him least: his own citizens, whom he has terrorized and oppressed; his neighbors, whom he has threatened and invaded. Citizens and neighbors alike have been killed by his chemical weapons. </P>  <P>[text omitted]<BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>This is not about inspectors finding smoking guns. It is about Iraqis' failure—Iraq's failure to tell the inspectors where to find its weapons of mass destruction.</SPAN> <BR><BR>The 12,200-page declaration Iraq submitted to the United Nations Security Council on December 7th utterly failed to meet the requirements of the resolution, utterly failed to meet the requirements of being accurate, full, and complete. Iraq attempted to conceal with volume what it lacked in veracity. Not one nation in the Security Council rose to defend that declaration. Not one person in this room could do so. The requirement for a declaration was put in as an early test of Iraq's intent to change its behavior. It failed the test. <BR><BR>This past week, United Nations Inspector [Hans] Blix and International Atomic Energy Agency Inspector [Mohamed] ElBaradei went to Baghdad to deliver the message that Iraq's cooperation has been inadequate. Iraq's response did nothing to alter the fact that Baghdad still is not providing the inspectors with the information they need to do their job. There is no indication whatever that Iraq has made the strategic decision to come clean and to comply with its international obligation to disarm. </P>  <P>The support of U.S. intelligence and the intelligence of other nations can take the inspectors only so far. Without Iraq's full and active cooperation, 100 or so inspectors would have to look under every roof and search the back of every truck in a country the size of California to find the munitions and programs for which Iraq has failed to account for. <BR><BR>After six weeks of inspections, the international community still needs to know the answers to key questions. For example: Where is the evidence—where is the evidence—that Iraq has destroyed the tens of thousands of liters of anthrax and botulinum we know it had before it expelled the previous inspectors? This isn't an American determination. This is the determination of the previous inspectors. Where is this material? What happened to it? It's not a trivial question. We're not talking about aspirin. We're talking about the most deadly things one can imagine, that can kill thousands, millions of people. We cannot simply turn away and say, ""Well, never mind."" Where is it? Account for it. Let it be verified through the inspectors. <BR><BR>What happened to nearly 30,000 munitions capable of carrying chemical agents? The inspectors can only account for only 16 of them. Where are they? It's not a matter of ignoring the reality of the situation. Just think, all of these munitions, which perhaps only have a short range if fired out of an artillery weapon in Iraq, but imagine if one of these weapons were smuggled out of Iraq and found its way into the hands of a terrorist organization who could transport it anywhere in the world. </P>  <P>What happened—please, what happened—to the three metric tons of growth material that Iraq imported which can be used for producing early, in a very rapid fashion, deadly biological agents? <BR><BR>Where are the mobile vans that are nothing more than biological weapons laboratories on wheels? Why is Iraq still trying to procure uranium and the special equipment needed to transform it into material for nuclear weapons? <BR><BR>These questions are not academic. They are not trivial. They are questions of life and death, and they must be answered. <BR><BR>To those who say, ""Why not give the inspection process more time?"", I ask: ""How much more time does Iraq need to answer those questions?"" It is not a matter of time alone, it is a matter of telling the truth, and so far Saddam Hussein still responds with evasion and with lies. </P>  <P><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Saddam should tell the truth, and tell the truth now. The more we wait, the more chance there is for this dictator with clear ties to terrorist groups, including Al Qaeda, more time for him to pass a weapon, share a technology, or use these weapons again.</SPAN> <BR><BR>The nexus of tolerance and terror, of terrorists and weapons of mass destruction, is the greatest danger of our age. The international community knows what real disarmament looks like. We saw it in Kazakhstan. We saw it take place in the Ukraine. We saw it in South Africa. We see none of the telltale signs of real disarmament, honest disarmament, in Iraq. Instead of a high-level determination to work with inspectors, we have continued defiance. Instead of a transparent disarmament process, we get the same old tactics of deceit and delay, documents hidden in private homes, denial of reconnaissance flights, denial of access to people and facilities, the kind of access that must be unimpeded and unrestricted in order to be successful. <BR><BR>Tomorrow, Chief Inspectors Blix and ElBaradei will make their report to the United Nations Security Council. My government will study their report carefully, will study it with gravity, and we will exchange views on its findings that were presented with other members of the Council. <BR><BR>We are in no great rush to judgment tomorrow or the day after, but clearly time is running out. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>There is no longer an excuse for Iraqi denial of its obligation. We must have Iraq participate in the disarmament or be disarmed. <BR><BR>We should not [sic] understand what is at stake here. Saddam Hussein's hidden weapons of mass destruction are meant to intimidate Iraq's neighbors. These illegal weapons threaten international peace and security. These terrible weapons put millions of innocent people at risk.</SPAN> <BR><BR>It is more than that. Saddam's naked defiance also challenges the relevance and credibility of the Security Council and the world community. When all 15 members of the Council voted to pass U.N. Resolution 1441, they assumed a heavy responsibility to put their will behind their words. Multilateralism cannot become an excuse for inaction.

630,2003-01-27,White House Press Briefing by Ari Fleischer,"<P>Question: Beyond the process, if the president asked for the country to go to war, they're ultimately going to ask what it is the president is protecting the American people from in Iraq. What is he protecting us from? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Well, the biggest fear and the biggest concern is that Saddam Hussein does, indeed, possess weapons of mass destruction in the form of biological and chemical weapons. And I think it's important just to take one step back. And often we talk weapons of mass destruction, as if those are just vocabulary words. Weapons of mass destruction will inflict untold horrors on the civilized world. They can take the lives of hundreds of thousands, if not millions, as well as be a weapon of terror that can dramatically change the life that the American people have come to live and expect. <BR><BR>That is the fear, that Saddam Hussein will indeed unleash these weapons, if he is able to, or link up with terrorists who will do it for him. It is not an idle fear; it is a real fear, particularly since we went through what we've gone through as a country since September 11th. That is the core of it, David. If Saddam Hussein did not have these weapons, the president would not have this cause for concern. He has these weapons, he's used them before—that is the heart of the president's concern.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Question: Can I just follow on this apparent link to Al Qaeda that is being presented in still rather vague form? If the president believes that there is a real danger that Saddam Hussein would task, sell, somehow give his weapons of mass destruction to groups like Al Qaeda, why hasn't it happened since 1991, when we know during that period of time that Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda were busy plotting and carrying out attacks against the United States? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Well, what we do know is that there clearly have been in the past, and there have been contacts between senior members of—senior Iraqi officials and members of the Al Qaeda organization, going back for quite a long time. We know, too, that several of the detainees, particularly some of the high-level detainees, have said that Iraq provided some training to Al Qaeda in chemical weapons development. <BR><BR>There are contacts between Iraq and Al Qaeda. We know that Saddam Hussein has a long history of terrorism, in general. And, again, if you're waiting for the smoking gun, the problem is when you see the smoke coming out of the gun it's too late, the damage has been done.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Question: I understand that. But we're talking about a period of well over 10 years, at a time when Al Qaeda was at full strength, you know, tearing it up, attacking U.S. embassies. If they wanted this kind of thing, as the president said they do, why didn't they get it through those contacts and through that training? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: One factor I think you also have to consider is, given the fact that Afghanistan provided a very large training ground and operational ground to Al Qaeda, many of their needs were taken care of in Afghanistan until September 11th, and then their activities in Afghanistan have been widely disrupted. And this is an unfolding story, and I think you'll hear more of it. <BR><BR>Question: <EM>Chronicle</EM> reported yesterday that a number of major American corporations—including Hewlett-Packard and Bechtel—helped Saddam Hussein beef up its military in the '80s. And also <EM>The Washington Post</EM> last month in a front-page article by Michael Dobbs said the United States during the '80s supplied Iraq with cluster bombs, intelligence and chemical and biological agents. <BR><BR>In that same article they reported that Donald Rumsfeld, now secretary of defense, went to Baghdad in December '83 and met with Saddam Hussein, and this was at a time when Iraq was using chemical weapons almost on a daily basis in defiance of international conventions. <BR><BR>So there are some specifics, and the question is, if Iraq is part of the axis of evil, why isn't the United States and these American corporations part of the axis of evil for helping him out during his time of need? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Russell, as I indicated, I think that you have to make a distinction between chemical and biological. And, clearly, in a previous era, following the fall of the Shah of Iran, when there was a focus on the risks that were underway in the region as a result of the rise of Islamic fundamentalism in Iran, different administrations, beginning with President Carter, reached different conclusions about the level of military cooperation vis-a-vis Iraq. <BR><BR>Obviously, Saddam Hussein since that time has used whatever material he had for the purpose therefore of attacking Kuwait, attacking Saudia Arabia, attacking Israel. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>And, obviously, as circumstances warrant, we have an approach that requires now the world to focus on the threat that Saddam Hussein presents and that he presents this threat because of his desire to continue to acquire weapons and his willingness to use those weapons against others.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Question: Ari, this morning you said the administration was looking for a simple yes or no answer from the weapons report: is Iraq complying, or not. A few minutes ago you said it's clear that so far Iraq is not complying. It led to the situation and is showing—is giving the inspectors the runaround. So did this report answer your question, yes or no? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: The report that was provided by Hans Blix this morning answered an important question the administration has had, and that is, is Iraq complying? The report released in New York this morning shows, clearly, Iraq is not complying. <BR><BR>Question: Mohamed ElBaradei said this morning that he felt he could give credible assurance within a few months that Iraq did not have a nuclear weapons program. Now as recently as last week, the administration was saying they continue to have concerns about Iraq's program. Are you in disagreement with ElBaradei on that issue? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Well, I think there's no telling how long it will take because nobody knows whether Saddam Hussein will ever cooperate or not. By all experience, he has not cooperated. I remind you that our concern all along— <BR><BR>Question: He did say— <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>I remind you our concern all along has been, as we've said it unequivocally, Saddam Hussein has chemical weapons. Saddam Hussein has biological weapons.</SPAN> We have not made such a flat statement about nuclear weapons. We have been concerned about his pursuit to try to develop nuclear weapons. But we have never said that he has them. The biological and chemical can kill millions enough on their own. </P>  <P>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Question: Ari, two things. Yesterday in South Africa, former President Nelson Mandela said, ""All President Bush wants is Iraqi oil because Iraq produces 64 percent of the oil and he wants to get a hold of it."" He also said that America is ""so arrogant"" that they dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and killed innocent people. President Bush, on the other hand, yesterday said, ""either you're with us or you're with the enemy."" In saying this, does the President believe that Nelson Mandela, France and Germany are with the enemy? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: No, on the last point. And on the first point, if this was a war for oil, the United States would be the ones saying lift the sanctions. That way Iraq could pump oil. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>This is about peace, and this is about protecting people in the region and the American people from Saddam Hussein who has weapons that kill millions.</SPAN></P>",True,"WMD, chemical, biological, nuclear, Iraq, Al Qaeda, FS","George W.

For the next 12 years, he systematically violated that agreement. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>He pursued chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, even while inspectors were in his country. Nothing to date has restrained him from his pursuit of these weapons—not economic sanctions, not isolation from the civilized world, not even cruise missile strikes on his military facilities. <BR><BR>Almost three months ago, the United Nations Security Council gave Saddam Hussein his final chance to disarm. He has shown instead utter contempt for the United Nations, and for the opinion of the world. The 108 U.N. inspectors were sent to conduct—were not sent to conduct a scavenger hunt for hidden materials across a country the size of California. The job of the inspectors is to verify that Iraq's regime is disarming. It is up to Iraq to show exactly where it is hiding its banned weapons, lay those weapons out for the world to see, and destroy them as directed. Nothing like this has happened.</SPAN> <BR><BR>The United Nations concluded in 1999 that Saddam Hussein had biological weapons sufficient to produce over 25,000 liters of anthrax—enough doses to kill several million people. He hasn't accounted for that material. He's given no evidence that he has destroyed it. <BR><BR>The United Nations concluded that Saddam Hussein had materials sufficient to produce more than 38,000 liters of botulinum toxin—enough to subject millions of people to death by respiratory failure. He hadn't accounted for that material. He's given no evidence that he has destroyed it. <BR><BR>Our intelligence officials estimate that Saddam Hussein had the materials to produce as much as 500 tons of sarin, mustard, and VX nerve agent. In such quantities, these chemical agents could also kill untold thousands. He's not accounted for these materials. He has given no evidence that he has destroyed them. <BR><BR>U.S. intelligence indicates that Saddam Hussein had upwards of 30,000 munitions capable of delivering chemical agents. Inspectors recently turned up 16 of them—despite Iraq's recent declaration denying their existence. Saddam Hussein has not accounted for the remaining 29,984 of these prohibited munitions. He's given no evidence that he has destroyed them. <BR><BR>From three Iraqi defectors we know that Iraq, in the late 1990s, had several mobile biological weapons labs. These are designed to produce germ warfare agents, and can be moved from place to a place to evade inspectors. Saddam Hussein has not disclosed these facilities. He's given no evidence that he has destroyed them. <BR><BR>The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed in the 1990s that Saddam Hussein had an advanced nuclear weapons development program, had a design for a nuclear weapon and was working on five different methods of enriching uranium for a bomb. The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Our intelligence sources tell us that he has attempted to purchase high-strength aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production. Saddam Hussein has not credibly explained these activities. He clearly has much to hide. </P>  <P>The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.</SPAN> To the contrary; he is deceiving. From intelligence sources we know, for instance, that thousands of Iraqi security personnel are at work hiding documents and materials from the U.N. inspectors, sanitizing inspection sites, and monitoring the inspectors themselves. Iraqi officials accompany the inspectors in order to intimidate witnesses. <BR><BR>[text omitted]<BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Year after year, Saddam Hussein has gone to elaborate lengths, spent enormous sums, taken great risks to build and keep weapons of mass destruction. But why? The only possible explanation, the only possible use he could have for those weapons, is to dominate, intimidate, or attack.</SPAN> <BR><BR>With nuclear arms or a full arsenal of chemical and biological weapons, Saddam Hussein could resume his ambitions of conquest in the Middle East and create deadly havoc in that region. And this Congress and the America people must recognize another threat. Evidence from intelligence sources, secret communications, and statements by people now in custody reveal that Saddam Hussein aids and protects terrorists, including members of Al Qaeda. Secretly, and without fingerprints, he could provide one of his hidden weapons to terrorists, or help them develop their own.</P>",True,"Iraq, WMD, chemical, biological, nuclear, Al Qaeda, FS","Saddam Hussein, George W.

635,2003-01-28,"Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, Interview With Southeast Asian Journalists","<P>Wolfowitz: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>—now for some time, the effort to disarm Iraq of what I think are properly called weapons of mass terror, by which—the usual phrase is weapons of mass destruction—but in the hands of a government that deals with terrorists, I think the real issue is the danger that these chemical or biological or radiological, or even nuclear weapons could fall into the hands of terrorists. And I think they are weapons of mass terror.</SPAN> That is what concerns us, that we are trying in every way we know how to deal with the Iraqi issue peacefully, if at all possible, and making use of the United Nations, which had originally some sixteen resolutions on the subject. And last November, of course, we passed Resolution 1441, which was to give Iraq one last chance to comply with its requirements to disarm. We've been waiting 12 years for Saddam Hussein to do so, and as far as we can tell, he still has not made the decision to meet that requirement, even though he agreed to it as a condition of the ceasefire at the end of the Gulf War 12 years ago. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>And as the president has made clear, if the Iraqi regime continues to defy the U.N. by refusing to disarm itself, then if necessary, we will disarm them by force, disarm it by force.</SPAN> <BR><BR>In that connection, and I think particularly for my friends from Malaysia and Indonesia—but all of you probably run into this question—if it comes to the use of force, this is not going to be a war against Iraq. It is a war only against the Iraqi regime, and it's a regime that has been abusing its own people in a most gruesome way for decades now. And if we have to use force, we will do it with the maximum care to avoid harming innocents, maximum care to avoid harming the Iraqi economy. </P>  <P>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Question: Sir, you've mentioned the weapons idea, like for example, they bought the anthrax and everything. Is there evidence of some of that already in the hands of terrorist groups in other countries? <BR><BR>Wolfowitz: I would say our basic concern is what could happen, and the distinct possibility that it could happen. It's not just sort of purely theoretical. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>We know that there are ties between the Iraqi regime and a whole range of terrorist groups, including Al Qaeda, and we know that Saddam has these weapons.</SPAN> Whether he's actually turned them over to terrorists is not something that—I mean, we're not prepared to wait until that happens, and it's—if you stop and think about the situation in Afghanistan, by June or July or August of 2001, it was already too late to do anything in Afghanistan. The terrorists were all in the United States by then. In fact, the last hijackers arrived in April of 2001. The pilots all arrived the year before. You can't—it's in the nature of this kind of threat that the only time you really have hard evidence that it's on you is when it's hit. You know, a lot of Indonesians didn't believe that there was a threat until Bali happened. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>And I think it's enough to have evidence that he has the weapons, and we have evidence of that.</SPAN> It's enough to have evidence that he works with terrorists; we have that. And what we're trying to do is to stop him, remove those weapons from his hands before he hands them over to terrorists. <BR><BR>Question: Sir, I think (inaudible) about what is a question on a lot of people's minds is what appears to be a contradictory way that the U.S. is dealing with Iraq and with North Korea. Can you explain it a bit? Why is the U.S.— <BR><BR>Wolfowitz: Happy to, yes. We get this question here a lot, too, and it's not, in my view, contradictory at all. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>But if I could just start by mentioning, when the president spoke a year ago at the State of the Union message, and he identified North Korea and Iran and Iraq as three countries that posed a common danger—which is that they were countries that were all hostile to the United States quite openly—that had weapons of mass destruction and were developing more, and then had ties to terrorists.</SPAN> And he said, ""They represent a common danger in that respect."" And there was an outcry around the world and here, ""Why is the president lumping all these three countries together? Doesn't he understand they're different?"" <BR><BR>Well, over the course of the next few months, we laid out three different policies for each of those countries. And now that North Korea has emerged as exactly what the president said they were, which is a country that pays no regard for its agreements, people say, ""Well, how come you're treating North Korea differently from the other two?"" They are different. That's what the whole world said. They have a—pose a common danger, but each one in a different way. I would say among the many differences, the one that I would urge people to focus on most clearly is that we have now seventeen U.N. resolutions demanding that Iraq comply with the terms of the 1991 ceasefire. Quite a few of them address this issue of weapons of mass destruction. We have yet to bring the North Korean issue to the U.N., much less to have a U.N. resolution. And at the last meeting of the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency, they decided to give North Korea one last chance before they brought it to the U.N. <BR><BR>There are other differences, too, and I could go into them, but the point is, we are very serious about both policies. The fact that we have a North Korea problem, and we do, and the fact that we're going to deal with that problem in a deliberate and careful way should not then become a reason for saying, ""Well, Saddam, you—we said you had one last chance, but it turns out you have a lot more chances until we're finished dealing with North Korea."" You have to take them the way they come.</SPAN></SPAN></P>",True,"Iraq, WMD, chemical, biological, nuclear, FS","Saddam Hussein, George W.

There is more, and depending on how people calculate the risks of revealing it. Some of this evidence comes from people who risk their lives to give it to us and I'm not sure it can be revealed in a way to put somebody's name on it. Some of it comes from special means that we may decide are okay to sacrifice. But the evidence—even just quite public and open—that the U.N. declared five years ago on the stocks of anthrax and botulinum toxin and ricin, which is now the weapon of choice of the terrorists in London apparently. Saddam had these large quantities five years ago. The U.N. provided the evidence that he had them, and he hasn't even seen fit to come clean on those.

I think it's a very strong display of national unity that the whole country had a chance to see and the whole world had a chance to see. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Saddam Hussein has really made the case against himself and the president I think laid it out for the world. It's just a series of evil weapons unaccounted for, huge quantities of anthrax that can kill millions of people, huge quantities of botulinum toxin that can kill millions of people, ricin that can kill millions of people. He talked about the mobile biological labs, excuse me, production facilities that we have learned about from three different defectors. Saddam's made no accounting of them. He's made no accounting of the various things we know about his nuclear program. It's a pretty devastating case, and indeed his behavior toward the inspectors, his obstruction of surveillance flights, I think most seriously his intimidation of his own scientists. It's very clear from what we hear from various defectors, from refugees, from intelligence sources, but also just from the evident behavior of his own people that he is intimidating people and threatening them in all the old ways to continue supporting the lies that were contained in those 12,000 pages of his declaration.</SPAN> <BR><BR>So I think the president delivered a very strong message to the American people and to the world, and perhaps maybe Saddam Hussein will get it.

Some of these we probably will be able to talk about. Some of them come from people who risked their lives to tell us. So Secretary [of State Colin] Powell is going to have to decide next week what things we can say, what things we can't say. But there is, fortunately, an enormous body of information that indicates very clearly that Iraq has weapons, they haven't given them up, and they're engaged in a pattern of non-cooperation, intimidation, hiding, and concealing them—the complete opposite of what a country does when they want to get rid of them.</SPAN></P>",True,"Iraq, WMD, chemical, biological, nuclear, FS","Saddam Hussein, Paul Wolfowitz, George W.

645,2003-01-29,Defense Department News Briefing by Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and General Richard Myers,"<P>Rumsfeld: Good afternoon. In the State of the Union remarks last evening, the president made clear that Saddam Hussein poses a ""serious,"" to quote him, ""and mounting threat to our country, [and] our friends and our allies"" that cannot be ignored. As the president pointed out, the Iraqi regime has not accounted for some 38,000 liters of botulism toxin, 500 tons of Sarin, mustard gas, VX nerve agent, upwards of 30,000 munitions capable of delivering chemical weapons, and a number of mobile biological labs designed to produce biological weapons while evading detection. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>His regime has the design for a nuclear weapon; it was working on several different methods of enriching uranium, and recently was discovered seeking significant quantities of uranium from Africa. The regime plays host to terrorists, including Al Qaeda, as the president indicated. Saddam's regime hides military equipment in or near mosques, hospitals, civilian homes and has a history of using innocent civilians as human shields. That is why, as he said, our nation and the world must not allow a brutal dictator with a history of reckless aggression and ties to terrorism to dominate a vital region and threaten the United States. <BR><BR>For those who counsel more time for inspections, the president responded that we have given Saddam Hussein more than a decade to give up chemical, biological, and his nuclear weapon program. Yet nothing to date has restrained him: Not economic sanctions, not diplomacy, not isolation from the civilized world, not even cruise missile strikes on his military facilities. He's now refusing to cooperate with the 17th U.N. Security Council resolution.</SPAN> As Mr. [Hans] Blix's report pointed out, at what point do reasonable people conclude that we know his answer as to whether or not he intends to cooperate and voluntarily disarm? As the president made clear, the dictator of Iraq is not disarming; to the contrary, he is deceiving. His time to do so is running out. It's up to Iraq to prevent the use of force. And let's hope that they do so. </P>  <P>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Question: Mr. Secretary, I realize that intelligence is a touchy issue, but there are major questions about the information that Secretary [of State Colin] Powell will provide to the Security Council next week, I believe it's February 5th. People in this building, including you, have said that you have proof that Iraq is still cheating the inspectors in even the most recent inspections. Will the information that you provide, including perhaps satellite photographs, will it be more directed to show that the Iraqis are still cheating the inspectors? Or, will it provide direct information of weapons—that the Iraqis still have these weapons? Can you give us some information on this? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: Well, the president outlined a good portion of the case yesterday evening. The agency, Central Intelligence Agency, is in the process of developing the final materials that will be used by Secretary Powell. I do not—and they're in the process of declassifying certain things, and I do not know what that final draft will look like; I've seen earlier iterations, but there is—there certainly will be information that will be provided as they go through that declassification process. <BR><BR>I think the way to think about it is this; there's two . . . there's one threshold issue, and that's the issue of preemption. It is difficult for all of us who have grown up in this country and believed in the principle that unless attacked, one does not attack—other countries have had different approaches, but for the most part, our country has had a view that that was the way we did things; it was other countries that have attacked us, for the most part, and initiated conflicts. <BR><BR>The question, though, is, in the 21st century, with biological weapons, for example, that could kill hundreds of thousands of people, what does one do? Does one wait until they're attacked, or does one look at a pattern of behavior and a pattern—a fact pattern, and draw a conclusion? <BR><BR>And so that key threshold issue is one that our country, the people of our country and the world, have engaged. And because it's new and because it's difficult and not easy, and we have not—we've had September 11th and some 3,000 human beings, innocent men, women and children of all nationalities and religions lost their lives. A biological attack that killed 300,000 or more would affect people's judgment about whether or not they would prefer that their government act before the fact. And there is no doubt in my mind but that the overwhelming majority of the American people would prefer that their government take the kinds of steps necessary to prevent that type of attack. So that's the first issue. <BR><BR>The second issue is people are kind of looking for a photograph or a thing that they can hold up and say, ""Aha! That proves something."" As I've said here, the Congress spent months trying to connect the dots after September 11th, trying to figure out what happened. How did all of those things go along, and how could we not know it and stop it? And wouldn't we have acted preemptively to stop it, had we been able to figure out how to stop it? <BR><BR>It's hard to connect the dots even after the fact, these many months, with going over thousands of documents up there on the Hill. Now they've appointed another commission to look at it. It's even harder to connect the dots before something happens. <BR><BR>But if you think of this fact pattern, you have a country that had chemical and biological weapons and an active nuclear program, according to the U.N. inspectors who were in there, and according to information and documents that were found. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>You have a country that was asked by the United Nations in the 17th resolution to declare what they have—after lengthy diplomacy, lengthy economic sanctions—to declare what they have, bring it forward so that they can be disarmed.</SPAN> You have a country that agreed to do that. And then you have a country that declined to do it, by filing a declaration that was fraudulent, by taking steps to inhibit the inspectors from doing their work in a reasonable way, by behaving totally differently than South Africa or Ukraine or Kazakhstan, which invited inspectors in, showed the world what they had, had them dismantled and disarmed, totally opposite. They're telling their people to lie to the inspectors, they're telling their people to hide things. They are taking documentation and putting it in multiple locations. You have a country that is out in the world buying things that are necessary for the development and progress in their chemical, biological and nuclear programs. And they're doing it not openly and saying it's dual use material and we're doing it innocently, but clandestinely, and paying more money than they need to. <BR><BR>So if you work your way down there, and then you say to yourself, ""this is a country that's not a normal country."" This is not Canada, or Australia, or some country that behaves as a good citizen of the world. This is a country that has used chemical weapons against its own people, that's used chemical weapons against its neighbors, that fired ballistic missiles into four countries in the region, that's threatened the United States of America, that has relationships with terrorist networks. <BR><BR>Now, what does all that force a person to think? It seems to me that at some point one has to say, ""what ought a person to think about all of that?"" And that's—that to me is evidence as hard as a photograph. And indeed, it is critically important for people to engage it in that fact pattern and come to their own conclusion about how do they feel about that. <BR><BR>Question: Mr. Secretary— <BR><BR>Question: But—but Old Europe, as you put it earlier this week, is looking for something hard— <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: You had to do it, didn't you, Charlie? (Laughter.) <BR><BR>Question: Well, I— <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: You had to do it. You had to do it. <BR><BR>Question: Well, are you—if you're not going to provide a smoking gun, such as a—a photograph, what—how do you—how do you plan to convince these people to go along with you? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: The secretary of state will be making a presentation to the United Nations, and the president will make a judgment, and the Security Council, undoubtedly, will be making a judgment, and individuals will be making a judgment. And it's a tough set of issues that people have to engage and wrestle with. And on the one hand, there's a risk of acting, and on the other hand, there are risks of not acting.

648,2003-01-30,White House Press Briefing by Ari Fleischer,"Question: Senator [Edward] Kennedy had a speech yesterday. Are you going to be able to provide the undeniable proof to silence the critics? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Again, I think people will judge the information that they already have had. I think that most Americans, even before the State of the Union, agreed that Saddam Hussein was a threat and that they would support the judgment if the president were to make it to use force to remove the threat from Saddam Hussein using weapons of mass destruction that we all know, the United Nations knows and others know that he has. And we'll just leave it at that.</SPAN>&nbsp;<BR><BR>[text omitted]&nbsp;<BR><BR>Question: Ari, the president mentioned something that was mentioned earlier, the aluminum tubes as part of the list of evidence that the U.S. thinks that Saddam Hussein has got weapons of mass destruction. But the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] and other world officials—Mohamed ElBaradei, actually, specifically said that it's just not there, that is not what that it's intended to be used for in Iraq, that it's really just conventional. Isn't there a concern that when the president and the White House make statements like that it's going to undermine your overall argument of this Mt. Everest of evidence that you say exists? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: No. And I'll give you three reasons why, in the president's judgment. Number one, Mohamed ElBaradei and the IAEA said that the importations of these tubes is illegal and violates the policies that Iraq committed itself to, regardless of what the IAEA has so far judged them to be. They said Iraq's actions in importing them are, in and of themselves, a violation. That should be a cause for concern, number one, about whether Iraq is disarming. <BR><BR>Number two, on the tubes, the IAEA has said that their investigation remains open. They have not reached final conclusions about this. On that point, therefore, to point three, there are continuing discussions with the IAEA in which information is being shared about this information. The preponderance of evidence is that Iraq attempted to procure high-strength aluminum tubes for uranium enrichment. We stand by that statement. <BR><BR>Our technical analysis at the extremely tight manufacturing tolerances and high-strength materials indicates the tubes far exceed any specifications required for non-nuclear capabilities. Iraq attempted to procure the tubes covertly. The cost of the tubes is far greater than what one would pay for if the tubes were just to be used for artillery. Iraq has devoted substantial efforts to concealing its nuclear program in the past. It's not surprising that it would attempt to mislead the inspectors on this issue and the inspectors have left it open because they want to continue to hear from us and to work on this before final conclusions are reached. The president stands by every word he said.",True,"Iraq, WMD, chemical, biological, nuclear, FS","Saddam Hussein, George W.

Secretary Powell will make a strong case about the danger of an armed Saddam Hussein. He will make it clear that Saddam Hussein is fooling the world, or trying to fool the world.

The one thing I would say, however, is I've absolutely no doubt at all that unless we deal with both of these threats, they will come together in a deadly form. Because, you know, what do we know after September the 11th? We know that these terrorists networks would use any means they can to cause maximum death and destruction. And we know also that they will do whatever they can to acquire the most deadly weaponry they can. And that's why it's important to deal with these issues together.&nbsp;<BR><BR>[text omitted]&nbsp;<BR><BR>Question: Mr. President, an account of the White House after 9/11 says that you ordered invasion plans for Iraq six days after September the 11th—Bob Woodward's account.

We were trying to fashion a sanction regime that would make it more likely to be able to contain somebody like Saddam Hussein. After September the 11th, the doctrine of containment just doesn't hold any water, as far as I'm concerned. I've told you the strategic vision of our country shifted dramatically, and it shifted dramatically because we now recognize that oceans no longer protect us, that we're vulnerable to attack.

That approach, of course, is appropriate when the objective is to protect the rights of the accused. But in an age of weapons of mass destruction and weapons that can kill tens of thousands of innocent people, our goal has to be to take all reasonable steps to protect the lives of our citizens. That is a quite different task. What is being tested during this period is not whether the inspectors can discover something that the Iraqi regime is determined to hide; quite the contrary. What is being tested is whether or not, after more than a decade, Saddam Hussein will finally cooperate with the U.N. resolutions requiring his cooperation. Regrettably, the answer is more apparent every day as he continues to deceive and deny and reject those U.N. resolutions.&nbsp;</P>  <P>[text omitted]&nbsp;<BR><BR>Question: Mr. Secretary, on Iraq, as you very well know, United—Powell's going to be going before the United Nations tomorrow. The inspectors have found a 17th empty chemical warhead.

(Laughter.) <BR><BR>Myers: That's what I would say on that. <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: First of all, it would be inaccurate for people to take your question and think that it was correct. But it is not correct. The idea that all there has been is circumstantial evidence is false. I don't know what the technical definition of ""evidence"" is, but—legally, but I do know that a good number of the things that have been released by the United Kingdom and by the United States already, let alone what the—will be presented by Secretary Powell tomorrow morning, are evidence. <BR><BR>Now, someone could say, well, it's powerful, or it's less powerful, or it's weak, or it's strong. But it's evidence. And we—I got a—had a discussion with Senator [Arlen] Specter recently about that, who was a—I guess a defense attorney and a prosecutor. And he described that process. <BR><BR>But we're not in a court of law, and I think that it's a misunderstanding. What's being tested, as I said, is whether or not Iraq is going to cooperate and provide the United Nations with its weapons of mass destruction and permit them to be destroyed. That is what the resolution is about. That is what the 16 resolutions are about. And this fixation that people have on the kinds of—this smoking gun business, I think, is a misunderstanding of what we're doing and what's going on in this world and what the nature of the threat is and what the danger is. <BR><BR>Question: Mr. Secretary, today in a broadcast interview, Saddam Hussein said, ""There is only one truth: Iraq has no weapons of mass destruction whatsoever."" And he went on to say, ""I would like to tell you directly we have no relationship with Al Qaeda."" <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: And Abraham Lincoln was short. <BR><BR>Question: Would you care to respond directly to what Saddam Hussein has said today? <BR><BR>(Pause.) <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: How does one respond to that? I mean, he said that Secretary Powell's words tomorrow are going to be lies. He says that the photographs that will be shown will be doctored. That's what he does. That's what he does. And then the world's press spreads it around the world as though it's true. It's utter—it's just a continuous pattern. This is a case of the local liar coming up again and people repeating what he said and forgetting to say that he never—almost never—rarely tells the truth. <BR><BR>Question: But he also challenged anyone who has any evidence to bring it forward. It was almost a response to what Secretary Powell said yesterday when he acknowledged the U.S. has no smoking gun. <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: If I were—well, I guess there's no way to recast this whole issue, but the fixation on a smoking gun is fascinating to me. Go back to September 11th and think of trying to piece together facts and information in a way that you could stop that from happening and stop those 3,000 people from being killed and stop those airplanes from crashing into the Pentagon and the World Trade Center and Pennsylvania. There's no smoking gun in there! You get the smoking gun after the planes have crashed. It is a—the people who keep repeating that are Saddam Hussein and his crowd and people who are chasing the wrong rabbit. <BR><BR>It is unfortunate that the test seems to be that—for a lot of people—when in fact, the test in the U.N. resolution, if people would read it, is whether or not Saddam Hussein is going to cooperate. And we know he's not. What has he done? He has filed a fraudulent, false declaration, that anyone who looks at it and reads it says is incomplete and inaccurate. He has refused to allow these inspectors free reign in that country. They often have more Iraqi intelligence minders encircling the inspectors than there are inspectors, by a factor of some non-trivial number. When they arrive someplace, they often are welcomed and expected. The people who the resolution requires be allowed to leave the country are not even allowed to be interviewed alone to see if they would like to leave the country. It is a—there is a pattern that is clear of a lack of cooperation. <BR><BR>And if the test is a smoking gun, then the implication is that the test is not cooperation, the test is that these inspectors, these relatively handfuls of inspectors are supposed to go in there and find something he doesn't want them to find. How in the world can they do that? That is never what was intended, or they would have been called discoverers and finders, not inspectors. The only role they had was to go in and inspect what he offered up.</P>",True,"Iraq, WMD, chemical, biological, nuclear, Al Qaeda, FS","Saddam Hussein, George W. Bush, Donald Rumsfeld, Richard B.

662,2003-02-05,Secretary of State Colin Powell Addresses the U.N. Security Council,"<P>Powell: First, biological weapons. We have talked frequently here about biological weapons. By way of introduction and history, I think there are just three quick points I need to make. <BR><BR>First, you will recall that it took UNSCOM [United Nations Special Commission] four long and frustrating years to pry—to pry—an admission out of Iraq that it had biological weapons. </P>  <P><BR>Second, when Iraq finally admitted having these weapons in 1995, the quantities were vast. Less than a teaspoon of dry anthrax, a little bit about this amount—this is just about the amount of a teaspoon—less than a teaspoon full of dry anthrax in an envelope shutdown [sic] the United States Senate in the fall of 2001. This forced several hundred people to undergo emergency medical treatment and killed two postal workers just from an amount just about this quantity that was inside of an envelope. <BR><BR>Powell: Iraq declared 8,500 liters of anthrax, but UNSCOM estimates that Saddam Hussein could have produced 25,000 liters. If concentrated into this dry form, this amount would be enough to fill tens upon tens upon tens of thousands of teaspoons. And Saddam Hussein has not verifiably accounted for even one teaspoon-full of this deadly material. <BR><BR>And that is my third point. And it is key. The Iraqis have never accounted for all of the biological weapons they admitted they had and we know they had. They have never accounted for all the organic material used to make them. And they have not accounted for many of the weapons filled with these agents such as there are 400 bombs. This is evidence, not conjecture. This is true. This is all well-documented. <BR><BR>[text omitted]</P>  <P>One of the most worrisome things that emerges from the thick intelligence file we have on Iraq's biological weapons is the existence of mobile production facilities used to make biological agents. <BR><BR>Powell: Let me take you inside that intelligence file and share with you what we know from eye witness accounts. We have firsthand descriptions of biological weapons factories on wheels and on rails. <BR><BR>The trucks and train cars are easily moved and are designed to evade detection by inspectors. In a matter of months, they can produce a quantity of biological poison equal to the entire amount that Iraq claimed to have produced in the years prior to the Gulf War. <BR><BR>Although Iraq's mobile production program began in the mid-1990s, U.N. inspectors at the time only had vague hints of such programs. Confirmation came later, in the year 2000. <BR><BR>The source was an eye witness, an Iraqi chemical engineer who supervised one of these facilities. He actually was present during biological agent production runs. He was also at the site when an accident occurred in 1998. Twelve technicians died from exposure to biological agents.&nbsp;<BR><BR>[text omitted]&nbsp;<BR><BR>This defector is currently hiding in another country with the certain knowledge that Saddam Hussein will kill him if he finds him. His eye-witness account of these mobile production facilities has been corroborated by other sources. <BR><BR>A second source, an Iraqi civil engineer in a position to know the details of the program, confirmed the existence of transportable facilities moving on trailers. <BR><BR>A third source, also in a position to know, reported in summer 2002 that Iraq had manufactured mobile production systems mounted on road trailer units and on rail cars. <BR><BR>Finally, a fourth source, an Iraqi major, who defected, confirmed that Iraq has mobile biological research laboratories, in addition to the production facilities I mentioned earlier.&nbsp;<BR><BR>[text omitted]&nbsp;<BR><BR>We know that Iraq has at lest seven of these mobile biological agent factories. The truck-mounted ones have at least two or three trucks each. That means that the mobile production facilities are very few, perhaps 18 trucks that we know of—there may be more—but perhaps 18 that we know of. Just imagine trying to find 18 trucks among the thousands and thousands of trucks that travel the roads of Iraq every single day. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>It took the inspectors four years to find out that Iraq was making biological agents. How long do you think it will take the inspectors to find even one of these 18 trucks without Iraq coming forward, as they are supposed to, with the information about these kinds of capabilities?</SPAN> <BR><BR>Powell: Ladies and gentlemen, these are sophisticated facilities. For example, they can produce anthrax and botulinum toxin. In fact, they can produce enough dry biological agent in a single month to kill thousands upon thousands of people. And dry agent of this type is the most lethal form for human beings.&nbsp;<BR><BR>[text omitted]&nbsp;<BR><BR>We have evidence these weapons existed. What we don't have is evidence from Iraq that they have been destroyed or where they are. That is what we are still waiting for. <BR><BR>Third point, Iraq's record on chemical weapons is replete with lies. It took years for Iraq to finally admit that it had produced four tons of the deadly nerve agent, VX. A single drop of VX on the skin will kill in minutes. Four tons. <BR><BR>The admission only came out after inspectors collected documentation as a result of the defection of Hussein Kamal, Saddam Hussein's late son-in-law. UNSCOM also gained forensic evidence that Iraq had produced VX and put it into weapons for delivery. Powell: Yet, to this day, Iraq denies it had ever weaponized VX. And on January 27, UNMOVIC [U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission]&nbsp;told this council that it has information that conflicts with the Iraqi account of its VX program.&nbsp;<BR><BR>[text omitted]&nbsp;<BR><BR>I'm going to show you a small part of a chemical complex called al-Moussaid (ph), a site that Iraq has used for at least three years to transship chemical weapons from production facilities out to the field. In May 2002, our satellites photographed the unusual activity in this picture. Here we see cargo vehicles are again at this transshipment point, and we can see that they are accompanied by a decontamination vehicle associated with biological or chemical weapons activity. <BR><BR>Powell: What makes this picture significant is that we have a human source who has corroborated that movement of chemical weapons occurred at this site at that time. So it's not just the photo, and it's not an individual seeing the photo. It's the photo and then the knowledge of an individual being brought together to make the case. <BR><BR>This photograph of the site taken two months later in July shows not only the previous site, which is the figure in the middle at the top with the bulldozer sign near it, it shows that this previous site, as well as all of the other sites around the site, have been fully bulldozed and graded. The topsoil has been removed. The Iraqis literally removed the crust of the earth from large portions of this site in order to conceal chemical weapons evidence that would be there from years of chemical weapons activity. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>To support its deadly biological and chemical weapons programs, Iraq procures needed items from around the world using an extensive clandestine network. What we know comes largely from intercepted communications and human sources who are in a position to know the facts.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Iraq's procurement efforts include equipment that can filter and separate micro-organisms and toxins involved in biological weapons, equipment that can be used to concentrate the agent, growth media that can be used to continue producing anthrax and botulinum toxin, sterilization equipment for laboratories, glass-lined reactors and specialty pumps that can handle corrosive chemical weapons agents and precursors, large amounts of vinyl chloride, a precursor for nerve and blister agents, and other chemicals such as sodium sulfide, an important mustard agent precursor.&nbsp;<BR><BR>[text omitted]&nbsp;<BR><BR>Powell: Just a few weeks ago, we intercepted communications between two commanders in Iraq's Second Republican Guard Corps. One commander is going to be giving an instruction to the other. You will hear as this unfolds that what he wants to communicate to the other guy, he wants to make sure the other guy hears clearly, to the point of repeating it so that it gets written down and completely understood. Listen. <BR><BR>(BEGIN AUDIO TAPE) <BR><BR>[Speaking in Foreign Language.] <BR><BR>(END AUDIO TAPE) <BR><BR>Powell: Let's review a few selected items of this conversation. Two officers talking to each other on the radio want to make sure that nothing is misunderstood: <BR><BR>""Remove. Remove"" <BR><BR>The expression, the expression, ""I got it"" <BR><BR>""Nerve agents. Nerve agents. Wherever it comes up"" <BR><BR>""Got it"" <BR><BR>""Wherever it comes up"" <BR><BR>""In the wireless instructions, in the instructions"" <BR><BR>""Correction. No. In the wireless instructions"" <BR><BR>""Wireless. I got it"" <BR><BR>Why does he repeat it that way? Why is he so forceful in making sure this is understood? And why did he focus on wireless instructions? Because the senior officer is concerned that somebody might be listening. <BR><BR>Well, somebody was. <BR><BR>""Nerve agents. Stop talking about it. They are listening to us. Don't give any evidence that we have these horrible agents"" <BR><BR>Well, we know that they do. And this kind of conversation confirms it. <BR><BR>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Our conservative estimate is that Iraq today has a stockpile of between 100 and 500 tons of chemical weapons agent. That is enough agent to fill 16,000 battlefield rockets. <BR><BR>Powell: Even the low end of 100 tons of agent would enable Saddam Hussein to cause mass casualties across more than 100 square miles of territory, an area nearly 5 times the size of Manhattan.&nbsp;<BR><BR>[text omitted]&nbsp;<BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Saddam Hussein has chemical weapons. Saddam Hussein has used such weapons. And Saddam Hussein has no compunction about using them again, against his neighbors and against his own people.</SPAN>&nbsp;<BR><BR>[text omitted]&nbsp;<BR><BR>In truth, Saddam Hussein had a massive clandestine nuclear weapons program that covered several different techniques to enrich uranium, including electromagnetic isotope separation, gas centrifuge, and gas diffusion. We estimate that this elicit program cost the Iraqis several billion dollars.&nbsp;<BR><BR>[text omitted]&nbsp;<BR><BR>Since 1998, his efforts to reconstitute his nuclear program have been focused on acquiring the third and last component, sufficient fissile material to produce a nuclear explosion. To make the fissile material, he needs to develop an ability to enrich uranium.&nbsp;<BR><BR>[text omitted]&nbsp;<BR><BR>Saddam Hussein is determined to get his hands on a nuclear bomb. He is so determined that he has made repeated covert attempts to acquire high-specification aluminum tubes from 11 different countries, even after inspections resumed. <BR><BR>These tubes are controlled by the Nuclear Suppliers Group precisely because they can be used as centrifuges for enriching uranium. By now, just about everyone has heard of these tubes, and we all know that there are differences of opinion. There is controversy about what these tubes are for. <BR><BR>Most U.S. experts think they are intended to serve as rotors in centrifuges used to enrich uranium. Other experts, and the Iraqis themselves, argue that they are really to produce the rocket bodies for a conventional weapon, a multiple rocket launcher.&nbsp;<BR><BR>[text omitted]&nbsp;<BR><BR>In 1999 and 2000, Iraqi officials negotiated with firms in Romania, India, Russia, and Slovenia for the purchase of a magnet production plant. Iraq wanted the plant to produce magnets weighing 20 to 30 grams. That's the same weight as the magnets used in Iraq's gas centrifuge program before the Gulf War. This incident linked with the tubes is another indicator of Iraq's attempt to reconstitute its nuclear weapons program. Intercepted communications from mid-2000 through last summer show that Iraq front companies sought to buy machines that can be used to balance gas centrifuge rotors. One of these companies also had been involved in a failed effort in 2001 to smuggle aluminum tubes into Iraq. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>People will continue to debate this issue, but there is no doubt in my mind, these elicit procurement efforts show that Saddam Hussein is very much focused on putting in place the key missing piece from his nuclear weapons program, the ability to produce fissile material. He also has been busy trying to maintain the other key parts of his nuclear program, particularly his cadre of key nuclear scientists.</SPAN>&nbsp;<BR><BR>[text omitted]&nbsp;<BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>But what I want to bring to your attention today is the potentially much more sinister nexus between Iraq and the Al Qaeda terrorist network, a nexus that combines classic terrorist organizations and modern methods of murder. Iraq today harbors a deadly terrorist network headed by Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi, an associated in collaborator of Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda lieutenants.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Zarqawi, a Palestinian born in Jordan, fought in the Afghan war more than a decade ago. Returning to Afghanistan in 2000, he oversaw a terrorist training camp. One of his specialities and one of the specialties of this camp is poisons. When our coalition ousted the Taliban, the Zarqaqi [sic] network helped establish another poison and explosive training center camp. And this camp is located in northeastern Iraq.&nbsp;<BR><BR>[text omitted]&nbsp;<BR><BR>Those helping to run this camp are Zarqawi lieutenants operating in northern Kurdish areas outside Saddam Hussein's controlled Iraq. But Baghdad has an agent in the most senior levels of the radical organization, Ansar al-Islam, that controls this corner of Iraq. In 2000 this agent offered Al Qaeda safe haven in the region. After we swept Al Qaeda from Afghanistan, some of its members accepted this safe haven. They remain their today. <BR><BR>Zarqawi's activities are not confined to this small corner of north east Iraq. He traveled to Baghdad in May 2002 for medical treatment, staying in the capital of Iraq for two months while he recuperated to fight another day. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>During this stay, nearly two dozen extremists converged on Baghdad and established a base of operations there. These Al Qaeda affiliates, based in Baghdad, now coordinate the movement of people, money and supplies into and throughout Iraq for his network, and they've now been operating freely in the capital for more than eight months. <BR><BR>Iraqi officials deny accusations of ties with Al Qaeda. These denials are simply not credible. Last year an Al Qaeda associate bragged that the situation in Iraq was, quote, ""good,"" that Baghdad could be transited quickly.</SPAN>&nbsp;<BR><BR>[text omitted]&nbsp;<BR><BR>Last year, two suspected Al Qaeda operatives were arrested crossing from Iraq into Saudi Arabia. They were linked to associates of the Baghdad cell, and one of them received training in Afghanistan on how to use cyanide. From his terrorist network in Iraq, Zarqawi can direct his network in the Middle East and beyond.&nbsp;<BR><BR>[text omitted]&nbsp;<BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>We are not surprised that Iraq is harboring Zarqawi and his subordinates. This understanding builds on decades long experience with respect to ties between Iraq and Al Qaeda.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Powell: Going back to the early and mid-1990s, when bin Laden was based in Sudan, an Al Qaeda source tells us that Saddam and bin Laden reached an understanding that Al Qaeda would no longer support activities against Baghdad. Early Al Qaeda ties were forged by secret, high-level intelligence service contacts with Al Qaeda, secret Iraqi intelligence high-level contacts with Al Qaeda. <BR><BR>We know members of both organizations met repeatedly and have met at least eight times at very senior levels since the early 1990s. In 1996, a foreign security service tells us, that bin Laden met with a senior Iraqi intelligence official in Khartoum, and later met the director of the Iraqi intelligence service. <BR><BR>Saddam became more interested as he saw Al Qaeda's appalling attacks. A detained Al Qaeda member tells us that Saddam was more willing to assist Al Qaeda after the 1998 bombings of our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Saddam was also impressed by Al Qaeda's attacks on the U.S.S. <EM>Cole</EM> in Yemen in October 2000. <BR><BR>Iraqis continued to visit bin Laden in his new home in Afghanistan. A senior defector, one of Saddam's former intelligence chiefs in Europe, says Saddam sent his agents to Afghanistan sometime in the mid-1990s to provide training to Al Qaeda members on document forgery. <BR><BR>From the late 1990s until 2001, the Iraqi embassy in Pakistan played the role of liaison to the Al Qaeda organization.&nbsp;<BR><BR>[text omitted]&nbsp;<BR><BR>Al Qaeda continues to have a deep interest in acquiring weapons of mass destruction. As with the story of Zarqawi and his network, I can trace the story of a senior terrorist operative telling how Iraq provided training in these weapons to Al Qaeda.&nbsp;<BR><BR>[text omitted]&nbsp;<BR><BR>Powell: His information comes first-hand from his personal involvement at senior levels of Al Qaeda. He says bin Laden and his top deputy in Afghanistan, deceased Al Qaeda leader Muhammad Atif (ph), did not believe that Al Qaeda labs in Afghanistan were capable enough to manufacture these chemical or biological agents. They needed to go somewhere else. They had to look outside of Afghanistan for help. Where did they go? Where did they look? They went to Iraq. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>The support that (inaudible) describes included Iraq offering chemical or biological weapons training for two Al Qaeda associates beginning in December 2000. He says that a militant known as Abu Abdula Al-Iraqi (ph) had been sent to Iraq several times between 1997 and 2000 for help in acquiring poisons and gases. Abdula Al-Iraqi (ph) characterized the relationship he forged with Iraqi officials as successful.</SPAN></P>",True,"Iraq, WMD, chemical, biological, nuclear, Al Qaeda, FS","Saddam Hussein, Colin Powell, Hans Blix, Osama bin Laden",http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/02/20030205-1.html,,"SOURCE: Office of the White House Press Secretary, address by Colin Powell, February 5, 2003.",Colin Powell

670,2003-02-06,"Defense Secretary&nbsp;Donald Rumsfeld, Interview on KING-TV","<P>Question: How close are we in your estimation to going to war with Iraq? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: Well, you know, I can't answer that question, because I just don't know. It is a matter that the United Nations is considering, and the president of the United States is considering. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>The Congress has voted overwhelmingly to support the president's concern about Iraq and their weapons of mass destruction.</SPAN> And the U.N. Security Council voted unanimously also for the first resolution. And we'll just have to see how it plays out. Certainly Secretary [of State Colin] Powell made a very persuasive case yesterday morning. </P>  <P>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Question: Senator [Joseph] Biden said on the Hill this morning, where Secretary Powell is testifying, that GI Joe and GI Jane may not come home right away after any military action in Iraq. It may be months, it may be years. Is that an assessment you would go along with? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: Oh, I think that the way I would characterize it—I didn't hear precisely what Senator Biden said, but the way I would characterize it is that the United States does feel an obligation. For example, in Afghanistan, having driven the Taliban out, having driven the Al Qaeda out, we still have, I suppose, something in the neighborhood of 9,000 American troops there. And they're there because we feel an obligation to see that that country has a chance to keep terrorists out and not simply go back to being a training ground for terrorists. And the international community is participating in that. We have other countries participating. </P>  <P><BR>In the event force has to be used to disarm Iraq, there is no question but that some much smaller number than would be involved in any conflict, a smaller number would be there along with other international forces to serve in a transition period to see that what succeeded Saddam Hussein was a regime, a government that did not have weapons of mass destruction, did not threaten its neighbors, was able to maintain a single country, and would be on a path towards providing the right kind of rights and freedoms to the various minority groups and ethnic groups in that country. <BR><BR>So he's right in the sense that it would take some U.S. presence. But it would be wrong to suggest that it would be the same people who were there that they would not come home. Or it would also be wrong to suggest that it would be the United States alone, because it wouldn't be. It would be a—we have a large number of countries who already volunteered to participate in a coalition of the willing. <BR><BR>Question: I'm speaking to you from the congressional district represented by Congressman Jim McDermott. You know his views on war with Iraq well, and a lot of people here in Western Washington just don't get why war with Iraq and why now. If you could address them now, what would you tell them? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: Well, I agree with them in the sense that war is always the last choice. And I think that if one goes back and thinks that it's been 12 years since the Gulf War, when Iraq invaded Kuwait, having already attacked its neighbor in Iraq, and having already used chemical weapons on its own people and on its neighbors, and having fired ballistic missiles into four of its neighboring countries—it's been 12 years and there's been an enormous diplomatic effort, and it's failed. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>There's been years of economic sanctions which didn't have to be there as long as Saddam Hussein would give up weapons of mass destruction. But he refused year after year after year.</SPAN> There's been limited military activity in the northern and southern no-fly zones. So what's taken place with the latest U.N. resolution, which was passed unanimously by the international community, said, ""Let's give Iraq one final opportunity to cooperate."" And his response was to file a fraudulent declaration. And, as Secretary Powell said yesterday, his response has been to try to deny and deceive and frustrate the work of the inspectors. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Now, why now? And the answer is that every week that goes by, his weapons of mass destruction programs become more mature;</SPAN> he has relationships with terrorist networks, as Secretary Powell indicated; there's an enormous body of evidence that's been presented. And I guess if one thinks back to September 11th, where 3,000 innocent men, women and children were killed, imagine that that's not the use of aircraft but instead it's the use of a biological weapon or a chemical weapon, or some day down the road a nuclear weapon.</P>",True,"Iraq, WMD, chemical, biological, nuclear, Al Qaeda, FS","Saddam Hussein, George W.

You can hardly drive down the block without seeing a road sign or a yard sign, ""No War With Iraq."" What would you tell people here—how would you justify this to them? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: Well, I would say the truth, and the truth is that war is always the last choice. It is—it has to be. And that what one has to do is to say, think about the amount of time that has been given to Iraq. It's been 12 years. This is the 17th U.N. Security Council resolution that has been passed. The country has systematically refused and violated each of the first 16. And with respect to the current resolution, which was described as the final chance after years of diplomacy, after years of economic sanctions, after years of limited military activity in the northern and southern no-fly zones, the U.N. resolution said this is Iraq's final opportunity. And the test was whether or not they would cooperate. They then proceeded to file a fraudulent declaration. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>They were required by the resolution to be honest about what they had. They did not. They then systematically tried to deny and deceive the inspectors and kibbitz and prevent them from being successful in their efforts. That is still a further breach, as Secretary [of State]&nbsp;Colin Powell said.</SPAN> <BR><BR>I think each person simply has to ask themselves the question: How much evidence, how much information, how much time—12 years—how many opportunities? Should there be a final, final opportunity? Or a final-final-final opportunity? <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>The danger in that is real, and it is that they have active biological, chemical and nuclear programs. They have weapons that are biological and chemical. They have relationships, as Secretary Powell said, with terrorist networks.</SPAN> And we just suffered 3,000 dead in the September 11th. If a—the United States were to experience a September 11th with a biological attack and not a conventional attack, we would see not just 3,000 people potentially but 30,000 or 300,000 people.

673,2003-02-06,"Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, Interview on KGO-TV","<P>Question: Secretary of State [Colin] Powell made some very telling points in his dramatic presentation at the U.N. yesterday. But did he make the case for war? <BR><BR>Wolfowitz: I think he made the case for being seriously concerned about the danger posed by Saddam Hussein. I think the American people, for the first time, had a kind of overview of the issues that have been troubling the president, now going back to the State of the Union message last year. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Our hope still is to persuade Saddam Hussein, or at least the people around him, that Iraq should disarm peacefully and that that would be a much better outcome than our having to use force. But the decision really rests with Baghdad at this point.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Question: What about containment? Critics say it's worked 12 years now, maybe not ideally, but it has kept him mostly out of mischief. Why not continue containment? <BR><BR>Wolfowitz: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>I think Secretary Powell made a powerful case of how containment isn't working, that he is continuing to develop his weapons. He's continuing all his past practices of hiding and concealing and cheating inspectors. And, worst of all, his connections with terrorists, which go back decades, and which started some 10 years ago with Al Qaeda, are growing every day. And we see this terrorist network, that cells have been disrupted in England and France and Spain, that are closely tied to facilities in Iraq and even to the Baghdad regime. It's a danger that is, as Secretary Powell said, one we cannot continue to live with.</SPAN>&nbsp;</P>  <P>[text omitted]&nbsp;<BR><BR>Question: You hear an awful lot of criticism that, listen, we're having problems with North Korea and we're treating them a lot differently than we're treating Iraq in this case. Would you respond to that, please? <BR><BR>Wolfowitz: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Well, first of all, the same goal is there, which is to remove weapons of mass terror from the governments that are themselves supportive of terrorists. And that's the problem the president identified in the State of the Union message last year, where he talked about the axis of evil.</SPAN> It's very interesting that, right after that speech, everyone said, ""Well, doesn't he understand that Iran and Iraq and North Korea are each of them a different kind of problem?"" And over the subsequent weeks, we laid out policies for each of those three countries that were, in fact, tailored to the specific circumstances of those countries and that are different. And now suddenly people say, ""Well, why are you treating North Korea differently from Iraq?"" Well, it is different. <BR><BR>First difference: We have 17 U.N. resolutions dealing with Iraq. It is time to make sure that they are enforced. We have yet to get agreement to take the North Korean issue to the United Nations, and that is an issue we're working on now with the International Atomic Energy Agency and with our allies in Asia and with China and Russia. So they're at very different stages of the diplomatic process. The goal remains the same, but the circumstances are different. <BR><BR>Question: You mentioned the administration would like a diplomatic solution. But what are the chances we can work out a diplomatic solution with Iraq? <BR><BR>Wolfowitz: Well, I think after what we've seen in Saddam Hussein's behavior, as laid out quite clearly in the evidence Secretary Powell presented yesterday, one can't be very hopeful about the chances. The only thing that remains is that perhaps, finally, he, or at least the people around him, will be persuaded that the course they're on is one that leads to their doom, and maybe they will change.

It's right up there as a nine or a 10. I think Secretary [of State Colin] Powell made that very clear in the very powerful presentation he gave the U.N. Security Council yesterday. <BR><BR>Question: In the intelligence that was released by the secretary yesterday, can you characterize how much was released? Is that 20 percent of what we know or, I guess, a broad spectrum of what we know? <BR><BR>Wolfowitz: I think it gives a very good sense of what we know. We know a lot more in almost every category the secretary discussed. But I think, for the first time, the American people got a very clear sense of the range of issues that have caused the president so much concern and caused him to treat this as a case of very serious danger to the United States.</P>  <P>[text omitted]&nbsp;<BR><BR>Question: Mr. Secretary, you're the expert on Iraq. You're the guy the president calls for information here. What is the strongest case the secretary made yesterday in front of the United Nations, do you believe? <BR><BR>Wolfowitz: Well, I think he—it was really three parts. He made it very clear that Saddam Hussein is actively working to deceive the inspectors and to defy the Security Council resolution; that secondly, <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>he has the most dangerous chemical and biological weapons known to man and that he is working on developing nuclear weapons; and, third, that he has, and has had for a long time, very dangerous connections to terrorist groups, including Al Qaeda and including, as Secretary Powell pointed out, one very active Al Qaeda cell run by this man [Abu Musab al-]Zarqawi, who appears to have close ties to Baghdad.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Question: I want to talk about that for just a minute. How close is the tie that people need to see between Al Qaeda and Iraq? And what specifically is Saddam Hussein and Iraq doing to support Al Qaeda? <BR><BR>Wolfowitz: I think it's important to understand that when we talk about terrorist networks, we probably see the tip of the iceberg. I suspect we know 10 percent of what there is to know. And if you just sort of think retrospectively how relatively little we knew before September 11th of what those terrorists were doing, and even if we had known that some of them were taking flight lessons, it wouldn't have told us what they had in mind. <BR><BR>So we're talking about people who hide their plans very carefully, and the connection to a government like that would be hidden even more carefully. And yet, in spite of that, we see, for example, close connections between Iraqi intelligence, and even the Iraqi leadership, and this network that is actively working to do attacks with ricin and other deadly toxins. Some of them have been arrested in London. Some have been arrested in Spain and elsewhere in Europe. We're working on finding as many of them as we can. The problem is, some of them are hiding, probably effectively. <BR><BR>Question: It's well known that Saddam Hussein supports terrorist organizations in Palestine—Hamas, Islamic Jihad, other groups like that. Do you think a result of Saddam being overthrown could be peace in the Middle East much quicker than we might believe? <BR><BR>Wolfowitz: Well, it wouldn't—it certainly isn't going to hurt the cause of peace in the Middle East if one of the major extremists is removed from the scene. Clearly there are many, many other issues. I wouldn't suggest for a minute that he's the main obstacle. <BR><BR>But I think it's not an accident that we made some of the greatest progress we've made in promoting peace between the Arabs and the Israelis in the early '90s, right after the defeat of Saddam Hussein in the Gulf War. That's when the Madrid conference was convened. That's when the Oslo agreement was concluded. It's very important to get back to an effective peace process.

But they also send a powerful signal to Saddam Hussein that he has very little time left to make that fundamental decision to disarm.</SPAN></P>  <P>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Question: The Iraqi government, in their reaction, has, of course, tried to discredit the evidence with colorful phrases that Americans can identify with, the idea of special effects being a part of the presentation. What is your read, the Defense Department's read and the administration's read on how effective the Iraqi argument against our evidence might be within the Security Council? <BR><BR>Wolfowitz: Well, let's remember that—what was it?—a couple of months ago, I believe, Saddam Hussein held a referendum on his position and power and he received 100 percent of the Iraqi vote. I mean, these people know a lot about special effects and manipulation, and they've been doing it for years. <BR><BR>What Secretary Powell presented were absolute hard facts that are verified by large organizations in our government. And, believe me, you cannot, in our government, put out that kind of information unless there's very solid agreement on it. <BR><BR>I think the Iraqis were caught with their pants down, and they're very embarrassed. <BR><BR>Question: I would say there are three concerns, major concerns, on the part of many Americans; I don't know if you agree. But one concern is that a war with Iraq would take away from the war on terrorism. People are very concerned about that, especially here in New York, as you can understand. How can you reassure them that this would not be the case if the unfortunate happens and we do have to go to war? <BR><BR>Wolfowitz: Look, I think, again, I would urge them to go back and look at the tape again or read the transcript of Secretary Powell's very lengthy presentation. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>It's very clear that Iraq is part of the war on terrorism, that we are dealing with terrorist networks that are connected in part to Baghdad. The great danger that the president has been focused on, really since the beginning, and certainly since his State of the Union message last year, is the danger of a connection between a country like Iraq that is ferociously hanging on to the most dangerous biological weapons, and its connections to terrorists. It's a dangerous country to deal with.

676,2003-02-06,White House Press Briefing by Ari Fleischer,"Mr. Fleischer: Let me make a statement about some events concerning Iraq and other matters, diplomatically, that have taken place: Yesterday and today mark important days of diplomatic achievement at home and abroad. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>In addition to Secretary Powell's presentation yesterday at the United Nations of the facts concerning Saddam Hussein's concealment of his weapons of mass destruction, the president today would like to thank the 10 nations of Eastern Europe that issued a statement yesterday in support of the United States' effort to disarm Iraq.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Question: Ari, can I ask you a follow up something you said this morning? Do you have reason to believe that Saddam Hussein is going to suddenly feign cooperation by agreeing to some things he hasn't agreed to before? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Well, judging by Saddam Hussein's efforts in the past to conceal and to deny and to cheat and retreat, it would not surprise anybody if all of a sudden Saddam Hussein showed a little bit of the tip of his iceberg. I don't think it would surprise anybody if all of a sudden Saddam Hussein, for example, allowed U-2 flights to fly, or all of a sudden showed up with some weapons which he's previously denied ever having. So it would not surprise anybody in the United States government if all of a sudden Saddam Hussein showed up with the little tip of his iceberg. <BR><BR>Question: Well, if he is to cooperate, how much of the iceberg does he have to show? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>All. Complete disarmament—</SPAN>just as promised to the United Nations when the United Nations Security Council passed its resolutions. <BR><BR>Question: Since you speak for the president, we have no access to him, can you categorically deny that the United States will take over the oil fields when we win this war? Which is apparently obvious and you're on your way and I don't think you doubt your victory. Oil—is it about oil? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Helen, as I've told you many times, if this had anything to do with oil, the position of the United States would be to lift the sanctions so the oil could flow. This is not about that. This is about saving lives by protecting the American people— <BR><BR>Question: We will not take over the oil fields, are you saying that? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: The oil fields belong to the people of Iraq, the government of Iraq, all of Iraq. All the resources— <BR><BR>Question: And we don't want any part of that? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer:—of Iraq need to be administered by the Iraqi government. And any action that is taken in Iraq is going to be taken with an eye toward the future of Iraq. And that involves the protecting of infrastructure, providing humanitarian aid. And that needs to be done by the Iraqi people. <BR><BR>Question: There are reports that we've divided up the oil already, divvied it up with the Russians and French and so forth. Isn't that true? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: What's the source of these reports that you cite? <BR><BR>Question: They're all over the place. <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Can you be more specific? <BR><BR>Question: That we have just—we will take the oil fields and then we will parcel out the oil. <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: But you cited some reports. I'm just curious about—if you can be more specific about the source of these reports that you're citing here today. <BR><BR>Question:—have you been reading the newspapers? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Can you be more specific? Anywhere in particular? <BR><BR>Question: Senator [Richard] Lugar said it. <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: No, there's no truth to that, that we would divide up the oil fields. As I— <BR><BR>Question: Your own people have said something—but I'm sorry I can't pinpoint it. <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: As I indicated, the infrastructure of Iraq belongs to the people of Iraq. And that is going to be respected. <BR><BR>Question: Why should you decide what is their infrastructure or their government? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Obviously, if the regime changes there will be a new government. And the government will represent the people of Iraq. <BR><BR>Question: A couple questions, Ari. They're unrelated, so let me take them one at a time, if I could. If Saddam Hussein starts to melt his iceberg and dribble out these weapons, doesn't that complicate things for you in terms of building world opinion to take military action, to say that he is not cooperating, that he is not in compliance with 1441? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: No, I think it makes the exact case that Hans Blix made when he went before the United Nations and said that Iraq has showed the tip of an emerged iceberg—we don't know, is how he put it—we don't know if the weapon launchers for chemical—with chemical warheads that were discovered by the inspectors represent the tip of a submerged iceberg, is how Hans Blix put it. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>But if, all of a sudden, something were to show up, after Saddam Hussein denied vehemently, repeatedly, including yesterday, that he doesn't have any weapons of mass destruction, it would underscore the fact that Saddam Hussein is again lying to the world.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Question: But you know what the arguments will be. The arguments will be, well, the process does seem to be working; he's disgorging this information, he's revealing his weapons; let's let that process continue. And then before you know it, you're into June. <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>There's only one thing that counts, and that is the complete and total disarmament of Iraq. That way the threat that Colin Powell discussed before the world yesterday can be removed from people around the world, so we don't have to worry about Saddam Hussein using the weapons that remain below water.</SPAN><BR><BR>[text omitted]&nbsp;<BR><BR>Question: President Putin and Chirac agreed today that a diplomatic solution should be found to Iraq. How do you interpret these machinations? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Well, I think the president would hope that a diplomatic solution can be found. The question is, if Saddam Hussein is not willing to be a partner to a diplomatic solution, <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>does the world sit by and do nothing, as Saddam Hussein continues to arm up and develop weapons, which as we saw from the Secretary's presentation yesterday, involves some of the most horrible chemical and biological weapons that mankind could ever imagine.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Question: And is he still undecided about a second resolution? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: The president is continuing, through the secretary of state and through his own efforts, to consult with friends and allies around the world about what course should come next, and that consultation process continues. <BR><BR>Question: Ari, you have a week, almost a week now before Hans Blix comes back to the Security Council. Can you tell us more specifically what the White House is going to do in that week to press its case? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Well, I think what comes next is ongoing diplomacy. The president is serious when he talks about the importance of listening to and leading around the world. The opinions of neighbors around the world—as I noted with the 10 European nations that came out with their powerful statement of support yesterday—are important. There are many nations that the president will continue to talk to. <BR><BR>One thing is for certain—and this is a trend around the world that you saw starting several weeks ago, and I think it's a trend that is accelerating with Secretary Powell's presentation—<SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>the world is increasingly seeing this from the United States' point of view that Saddam Hussein must disarm. If he does not disarm, a coalition will be assembled to disarm him.</SPAN> That is increasingly the point of view of leaders throughout the world. There may be some corners, some minority opinion that do not believe that. But that is why diplomacy remains important and will continue to be pursued. <BR><BR>Question: And what is ongoing diplomacy? Is that the president calling leaders— <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Yes. <BR><BR>Question: And what are you doing in this—yes? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Yes. <BR><BR>Question: What are you doing in this country to convince Americans that this is the right course? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Well, obviously, the president addressed many of these issues head on in his State of the Union address, <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>where the president talked about the risks of letting Saddam Hussein continue to be armed.</SPAN> Secretary Powell, in his presentation yesterday at the United Nations, was viewed by obviously tens of millions of Americans. And the president will continue to speak out, and members of his administration—as Secretary Powell testified before the Congress today—will continue to speak out in public about the facts that have been presented. <BR><BR>Question: According to the press reports and—officials that credible threats are still there, as far as terrorism is concerned—here and also in Afghanistan because Al Qaedas are coming back from Pakistan to Afghanistan. Fighting is going on there. Now, as far as this credible threat is concerned, is that in connection with anything to do with Saddam Hussein's connection with Al Qaeda? Or due to this sanction between the U.S. and Iraq? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Well, even without the situation in Iraq, we have, since September 11th, of course, prior to September 11th, it's clear that there—Al Qaeda is an organization that is dedicated to striking and hitting the United States anywhere and everywhere it can. And this is one of the reasons we have the new Department of Homeland Security, as you know. And September 11th, indeed, brought that home to the American people about how vulnerable we, indeed, are. <BR><BR>And so the Department of Homeland Security, as well as other agencies of the government, continue to monitor the threat environment to determine whether or not the reporting that we get around the world leads to any conclusions or other analysis. That's why the threat level remains elevated at yellow. It continues to be a concern that people around the world—regardless of what's happening in Iraq, including what's happening in Iraq—have a desire to strike. That's something that Secretary Powell talked about yesterday. <BR><BR>Question: Can I follow just one more? On Sunday a Muslim holiday starts and millions of Muslims will be gathering and going to pilgrim. Any message for the Muslims or how we should take this, because of the holiday, there might be some more threats.&nbsp;<BR><BR>[text omitted]&nbsp;<BR><BR>Question: To follow up on Elizabeth's question. How crucial is the report that Hans Blix is going to give the United Nations on February 14th for deciding how everything unfolds and how things come together? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Well, the importance of Hans Blix's next testimony will be determined by Saddam Hussein. If Saddam Hussein continues to deceive and to deny and to have arms, then it takes on more importance.</SPAN> And that's why this is all about the actions that Saddam Hussein needs to take to come into compliance. As we heard yesterday with the audio tapes that were released, instead of coming into compliance, Saddam Hussein is doing just the opposite. He is engaging in every bit and level of deception and denial that he can possibly, possibly get away with. <BR><BR>Question: Is there a hope by the White House that Hanx Blix will be as candid as possible about the fact that you don't think that Saddam Hussein is complying with the weapons inspection? I mean, how important is what he says to getting the French and others on board? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Well, Dr. ElBaradei and Hans Blix's jobs are describe the facts as they find them. That is why they've been sent to Iraq. And the facts as they find them are determined by the actions taken by Saddam Hussein's regime. <BR><BR>Question: Ari, the National Council of Churches, led by a former Democratic congressman, the Reverend Bob Edgar, has enlisted a bishop, Melvin Talbert, of the president's Methodist Church, to do a TV commercial, reported by <EM>The Washington Post,</EM> in which this Methodist bishop claims, ""Going to war against Iraq violates God's law and the teachings of Jesus Christ."" And my question is: Since the president is widely known to be a deeply religious person, he surely does not want you to suggest by any evasion that he agrees or does not care about this Methodist bishop's claim. So what is his answer to this bishop's charge of violating God's law? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Lester, the decisions that the president makes about war and peace and about whether or not force needs to be used in Iraq are based on the president's judgments as a secular leader about what is necessary to protect this country. The president is a deeply religious man. But these are decisions that the president will make based on intelligence reports, based on information that he is aware of on how to protect our country from potential attack. That's what's on the president's mind—particularly since September 11th.&nbsp;<BR><BR>[text omitted]&nbsp;<BR><BR>Question: Ari, back on Iraq. If Saddam Hussein does start to reveal some of his arsenal, do we have any way of verifying that he's not divulging all of it? I mean, how are we going to be able to verify that? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>I think the question is an interesting one to turn around here. And after you've been lied to and told by Saddam Hussein, and covered his statements on the air where he and his commanders say they have no weapons of mass destruction, what would you conclude if all of a sudden he starts coming out with ones or twos or threes or fours, or allows a U-2 to fly? Obviously, he lied. And if he lied about that, what else is he lying about?</SPAN> <BR><BR>We're not interested in the tip of the iceberg that Saddam Hussein may show above water. We're interested in the iceberg that remains under water that can sink the lives of tens of millions of people. <BR><BR>Question: But how will you ever know, if you don't know what the iceberg is and he's not revealing all of it — <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>I think as anybody who listened to Secretary Powell yesterday knows, we know enough to have enough concerns that the world is now facing a decision about whether force will have to be used to disarm Saddam Hussein.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Question: Aren't you really saying that war is inevitable then? I mean, if you can't verify it— <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: The president has not given up—the president has not given up hope. And one thing we continue to believe is by continuing to have world pressure put on Saddam Hussein, <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>we have not given up hope that he'll either leave the country or that he will disarm to such an overwhelming great degree that people can know. But when you consider the fact that the previous United Nations inspectors believed he had 30,000 liters of chemical weapons and biological weapons, of VX, of anthrax, it's going to require a large, large number of acres' worth of parking lots for the world to know that Saddam Hussein has taken his weapons out of hiding, put them out on the parking lot for them to be destroyed.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Question: In your statement when you started the briefing, you said you want peace, the administration wants peace. Many in this country and around the world want peace. They're going to be demonstrating in the next few weeks for peace. Is it wrong for them, or unpatriotic for them not to want war, as well? I mean, you're saying you want peace, but it looks like you're pushing toward war. <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: It is emphatically a patriotic act for people to protest on behalf of whatever cause they see fit in our country. And if some differ with the president and call for the use of no force and take to the streets peacefully to protest that, that's the finest tradition of America. It's not new. It's been the way the American people communicate with their government for hundreds of years. We settle our differences in this country through elections and through peaceful protest. And the majority will will prevail. And the president is confident that when he makes his case, <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>if he makes his case as Secretary Powell has made the case, that the American people agree with him about the risks of allowing Saddam Hussein to continue to have the chemical, biological weapons that he has.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Question: But it's not just about the protest that's scheduled in the next couple of weeks. It's about a feeling, a pervasive feeling that Americans just don't want war—even after General Powell's speech yesterday. <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Of course, Americans don't want war. But Americans have always, throughout our history, shown a willingness to fight for peace when peace was threatened. And in terms of the expressions of support, I think all you need to do to look at the representatives of the people, for example, in addition to the public polling that you all have, and when you see that last year in the Congress, in 2002, the vote in the Senate to authorize force was 77–23, and in the House it was 296–133.",True,"Iraq, WMD, chemical, biological, nuclear, Al Qaeda, uranium, FS","Saddam Hussein, George W.

I mean, the record is poor, at best. The man has been told to disarm for 12 long years. He's ignored the demands of the free world.</SPAN> And then we passed another resolution, and for 90 days he's—the best way I can describe it is—played a game with the inspectors. So the U.N. Security Council has got to make up its mind soon as to whether or not its word means anything. <BR><BR>And, you know, I've never felt we needed a resolution; [U.N. Resolution] 1441 speaks very clearly. It talks about serious consequences if he doesn't disarm. However, I said yesterday that it would be helpful to have a resolution so long as it demands compliance with 1441, confirms the spirit of 1441. But Saddam Hussein is—he's treated the demands of the world as a joke up to now, and it was his choice to make.

This is a person who we have proven to the world is deceiving everybody—I mean, he's a master at it. He's a master of deception. As I said yesterday, he'll probably try it again. He'll probably try to lie his way out of compliance or deceive or put out some false statement. You know, if he wanted to disarm, he would have disarmed. We know what a disarmed regime looks like. <BR><BR>I heard somebody say the other day, well, how about a beefed-up inspection regime. Well, the role of inspectors is to sit there and verify whether or not he's disarmed, not to play hide-and-seek in a country the size of California.

681,2003-02-07,White House Press Briefing by Ari Fleischer,"Mr. Fleischer: The president began early this morning with a phone call that lasted 20 minutes with President Jiang Zemin of China. The two discussed the situation in North Korea, as well as Iraq. President Bush stressed that time was of the essence in dealing with Iraq, and he stressed that the credibility of the United Nations was at stake. <BR><BR>Question: Can I ask, when the president said this morning he wants the U.N. Security Council to make up its mind soon, to do what? What does he want to see in this new resolution? What does he want not to be in there? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: The president, as he has said and as he has talked with numerous allies, particularly in Europe—the president has said that he would welcome a second vote by the United Nations Security Council that enforces the resolution that is already in place, which is <A href=""http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N02/682/26/PDF/N0268226.pdf?OpenElement"">Resolution 1441</A>, which said that this is Iraq's final chance to comply, that failure to comply would be seen as a material breach that would be met with serious consequences—in the words of the 15 members of the United Nations Security Council. <BR><BR>Question: Does the president think there is anyone in the world who believes he has not already made up his mind to go up to war at any cost, no matter what? Does he actually think that nobody has already made up—believes he has already made him mind up? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: I think what's, in the president's judgment, important, there is one person's mind who matters the most, and that's Saddam Hussein. The issue of whether or not war comes is a matter that Saddam Hussein will decide. And so when you say, has the president decided, the president remains hopeful that war can be averted. And the president strongly believes that the stronger the show of international unity and the stronger the creation of the military presence, building up alongside Iraq, we'll work to convince Saddam Hussein to do what he always should have done, and perhaps the peace can still be maintained. <BR><BR>Question: But the president actually thinks that people think he still might not go to war? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Well, there is really only one person the president worries about when it comes to, can war be averted, and that's in Saddam Hussein's— <BR><BR>Question: Why shouldn't he worry about what the American people think? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Well, obviously, the president worries deeply about what the American people think. He is responsible to the American people and to their protection, per the Constitution, which is why the president went to the United Nations Security Council last September. It's why the president worked so hard to achieve the result of the first tough resolution that the United Nations passed last November, and why the president directed Secretary [of State Colin] Powell to travel to New York this week to make the presentation of facts. <BR><BR>Question: Why doesn't he let the inspectors complete their work? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: There's only one person who can let the inspectors complete his work, and that person's name is Saddam Hussein.&nbsp;<BR><BR>[text omitted]&nbsp;<BR><BR>Question: After talking to the presidents of China and France, does the president here feel any more optimistic that he's going to get their votes in the Security Council on the kind of resolution that he wants? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Well, I'm not in the business of predicting the actions that will be taken by sovereign nations, that is up to them to do. <BR><BR>But I think what you are seeing here is a serious diplomatic effort underway and it's going to continue. And that is, I think, what the American people and what the world would expect. It is important for international organizations to have meaning. It is important for proliferation regimes to work if we're going to send a signal to the world that we will enforce proliferations regimes so that weapons of mass destruction cannot be spread or can be easily acquired with impunity from the very international organizations who at their heart and soul must be dedicated to the stopping of the Saddam Husseins now and in the future.&nbsp;<BR><BR>[text omitted]&nbsp;<BR><BR>Question: You indicated the president wanted any new resolution to reinforce 1441.

Is there some minimum level here that would be required for it to actually reinforce 1441? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: The minimum is that it would to enforce what Resolution 1441 meant. And what Resolution 1441 meant was it was final, the words of the United Nations—final. It said that Iraq is and continues to be in material breach.

To the contrary, the regime is pursuing an elaborate campaign to conceal its weapons materials and to hide or intimidate key experts and scientists. This effort of deception is directed from the highest levels of the Iraqi regime, including Saddam Hussein, his son, Iraq's vice president and the very official responsible for cooperating with inspectors.</SPAN> <BR><BR>The Iraqi regime has actively and secretly attempted to obtain equipment needed to produce chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. Firsthand witnesses have informed us that Iraq has at least seven mobile factories for the production of biological agents—equipment mounted on trucks and rails to evade discovery. <BR><BR>The Iraqi regime has acquired and tested the means to deliver weapons of mass destruction. It has never accounted for thousands of bombs and shells capable of delivering chemical weapons. It is actively pursuing components for prohibited ballistic missiles. And we have sources that tell us that Saddam Hussein recently authorized Iraqi field commanders to use chemical weapons—the very weapons the dictator tells us he does not have. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>One of the greatest dangers we face is that weapons of mass destruction might be passed to terrorists who would not hesitate to use those weapons. Saddam Hussein has longstanding, direct and continuing ties to terrorist networks. Senior members of Iraqi intelligence and Al Qaeda have met at least eight times since the early 1990s. Iraq has sent bomb-making and document forgery experts to work with Al Qaeda. Iraq has also provided Al Qaeda with chemical and biological weapons training. And an Al Qaeda operative was sent to Iraq several times in the late 1990s for help in acquiring poisons and gases.</SPAN> <BR><BR>We also know that Iraq is harboring a terrorist network headed by a senior Al Qaeda terrorist planner. This network runs a poison and explosive training camp in northeast Iraq, and many of its leaders are known to be in Baghdad. <BR><BR>This is the situation as we find it—12 years after Saddam Hussein agreed to disarm and more than 90 days after the Security Council passed Resolution 1441 by a unanimous vote. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Saddam Hussein was required to make a full declaration of his weapons programs. He has not done so.</SPAN> Saddam Hussein was required to fully cooperate in the disarmament of his regime. He has not done so. Saddam Hussein was given a final chance.

On September 11th, terrorist states discovered that missiles are not the only way to strike Washington—or Paris, or Berlin, or Rome, or any of our capitals. There are other means of delivery—terrorist networks. To the extent a terrorist state transfers weapons of mass destruction to terrorist groups, they could conceal their responsibility for an attack.</P>  <P>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Last week, President Bush spoke to the world about the threat posed by Saddam Hussein. This week, Secretary Powell presented additional information in the Security Council: </P>  <UL>  <LI>Intercepted communications between Iraqi officials,   <LI>Satellite images of Iraqi weapons facilities, and   <LI>Human intelligence—from agents inside Iraq, defectors and detainees captured in the global war on terror.</LI></UL><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>He presented not opinions, not conjecture, but facts demonstrating:   <UL>  <LI>Iraq's ongoing pursuit of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons;   <LI>Its development of delivery systems, including missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles;   <LI>Its tests of chemical weapons on human beings;   <LI>Its ongoing efforts to deceive U.N. inspectors and conceal its WMD programs; and   <LI>Its ties to terrorist networks, including Al Qaeda–affiliated cells operating in Baghdad.</LI></UL>  <P>It is difficult to believe there still could be question in the minds of reasonable people open to the facts before them. The threat is there to see. And if the worst were to happen—and if we had done nothing to stop it—not one of us here today could honestly say that it was a surprise. It will not be a surprise. We are on notice. Each of our nations. Each of us individually. Really the only question is: what will we do about it? </SPAN><BR><BR>We all hope for a peaceful solution. But the one chance for a peaceful solution is to make clear that free nations are prepared to use force if necessary—that the world is united and, while reluctant, is willing to act.</P>  <P>[text omitted]<BR><BR>The stakes are high. Iraq is now defying the 17th U.N. Security Council resolution. The Council voted to warn Iraq that this was its ""final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations."" Quote, unquote. The resolution, which passed unanimously, did not say the ""next to final opportunity."" It said the ""final opportunity."" And those who voted for it, and they voted unanimously, knew what it said. They were explicitly reminded what it said. The question is did the U.N. mean it? Did they mean it? We will soon know. <BR><BR>Seventeen times the United Nations has drawn a line in the sand—and 17 times Saddam Hussein has crossed that line. As last week's statement by the eight European leaders so eloquently put it, quote: ""If [those resolutions] are not complied with, the Security Council will lose its credibility and world peace will suffer as a result."" <BR><BR>Let me add these sad thoughts about the state of the United Nations. An institution that, with the support and acquiescence of many of the nations represented in this room, <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>that would permit Iraq, a terrorist state that refuses to disarm,</SPAN> to become soon the chair of the United Nations Commission on Disarmament, and which recently elected Libya—a terrorist state—to chair the United Nations Commission on Human Rights of all things, seems not to be even struggling to regain credibility.</P>",True,"Iraq, WMD, chemical, biological, nuclear, Al Qaeda, FS","Saddam Hussein, George W.

There's no question but that Germany is an important contributor in the global war on terrorism. <BR><BR>With respect to the success of the inspectors in Iraq previously, my impression of that process is that the inspectors discovered, found very little. What they did find they were alerted to by defectors, by people who left the country and told them where to find things, and they then were quite successful in finding things and destroying things. They were never fully successful in closing that gap of knowledge between what they believe exists and what was discovered and what was accounted for. There are sizeable gaps as Secretary Powell pointed out. <BR><BR>As to the concept of containment, there's no question but that the steadfastness of the West over many decades, and successive leaders in all of our countries from all political parties had an effect in deterring and defending Western Europe and indeed the world from the Soviet Union's efforts to encroach. That's correct. That was a very different threat. <BR><BR>The threats we face today are just different, completely different. And containment—I heard the phrase, we keep Saddam Hussein in the box. I heard that a lot during the '90s. He wasn't in the box. Those borders are porous. Things are flowing across those borders going both ways every single minute of the day. We know that. <BR><BR>The combined efforts of the technically advanced countries of the world to prevent him from receiving the kinds of technologies to develop those weapons have failed. He has not been contained. He is successfully getting into that country darn near everything he wants.</P>  <P>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Moran: Good morning, Mr. Secretary, [at the U.N.] Secretary Powell laid out a credible case for what will happen if we don't intervene militarily in Iraq. Would you share with us your vision of what will happen if we do go to war with Iraq? For example the extent, the multilateral dimensions and duration of military control that might be necessitated before handing over civilian governance to acceptable leadership and where you think we might find that leadership. And especially, how we are prepared to deal with any adverse reactions in unstable allied governments in the Middle East such as Jordan and in Asia such as Indonesia and the nuclear-equipped regime of President Musharraf of Pakistan? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: Those are tough questions and they're important questions. The United States and other countries that are cooperating with the United States have been doing a good deal of planning and thinking through those issues. It's not possible to know how long, if force has to be used, how long it would take. Whether it's four days or four weeks or four months or somewhat longer, I can't say that anyone can answer. <BR><BR>The principles that we have worked with, with our friends and allies, and there are a large number of countries and a growing number of countries that are committed to participate in a coalition of the willing if necessary, both with respect to the use of force, but also with respect to the post-Saddam Hussein period. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>The principles are first that there be a single country, that it not be broken up; that it be a country without weapons of mass destruction;</SPAN> that it be a country that does not threaten its neighbors; and that it be a country that puts itself on a path towards some sort of representation and involvement on the part of the various ethnic groups and religious groups in the country.

689,2003-02-09,Secretary of State Colin Powell on ABC's <EM>This Week</EM>,"<P>Mr. Stephanopoulos: Let's start with that French–German plan. They say they're going to come to the U.N. later this week and put forward a plan that involves doubling or tripling the number of inspectors, more reconnaissance flights, more bases for the inspectors, and, perhaps most important, they want this all enforced by a U.N. peacekeeping force. <BR><BR>What do you think of that plan? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: Well, frankly, I have not seen this plan. It has been speculated about in the press for the last 24 hours, but I do not know what the plan actually is. But I suspect it is a variation of what the French Foreign Minister discussed at the U.N. on Wednesday, and that is increasing the number of inspectors and giving them more robust instructions. <BR><BR>But I do not know what that accomplishes. The issue is not more inspectors or more robust inspections;<SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED> the issue is will Iraq comply, will it give up its weapons of mass destruction. The resolution that we are trying to execute, 1441, accepted as a fact that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction—the French knew that, all the other members of the Security Council knew it—said Iraq was in material breach and said it had to come into compliance or else serious consequences would flow. <BR><BR>So the issue is not more inspectors. If Iraq was complying, giving up these weapons of mass destruction,</SPAN> telling us what happened to the mustard gas, what happened to the anthrax, what happened to the botulinum toxin, where did all the missiles go, where did all this material go, where are the documents, bring forward not just one or two people to be interviewed, bring forward everybody to be interviewed. If they were doing what they were supposed to be doing, the inspectors that are there would be more than enough. You could do it with half as many inspectors.</P>  <P>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Mr. Stephanopoulos: You mentioned Hans Blix's mission this weekend. If he comes forward next Friday, big moment at the U.N. Security Council, and says we've made some progress with the Iraqis this week and we need more time, what will the U.S. response be? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: I do not want to speculate on what—on this hypothetical situation. Let us wait and see what Dr. Blix and Dr. ElBaradei say on Friday. But I do not think we can keep stringing this out and giving them more and more time. We know why the Iraqis want more and more time. They're trying to stretch this out in the hope that it will just sort of dissipate and fall apart and everybody will go walking away and we will be faced with the same situation we were faced with last year next year, <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>and that is that we have this regime, this dictatorial regime that has not given up its commitment to developing weapons of mass destruction to threaten its neighbors and to threaten the world.</SPAN></P>  <P>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Mr. Stephanopoulos: Let's go back to your presentation at the United Nations this week. At one point, and I want to show our viewers what you showed: pictures of a camp in Northern Iraq, a terrorist training camp, you said. We had our own reporters go there over the week and we're going to also show now that videotape and I'd like to get your response. What they seemed to find as they went through the camp was a very rudimentary camp, not much electricity from a single generator, no running water. It didn't appear to be—and, of course, these are not trained inspectors, but it did not appear to be to them any kind of a terrorist training camp where poison gas was used. <BR><BR>How do you respond to that? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: If it really was supposed to be a terrorist training camp, the reporters would not be allowed in. You can be sure that anything that the owners of that camp did not want reporters to see, reporters did not see. <BR><BR>Another version of reporters reporting that went into that camp said we did not see anything but, you know, suddenly we were taken to a bunker which had video cameras and which had power and which was sophisticated, had computers, state-of-the-art. And so do not underestimate what can be hidden. <BR><BR>We are not just relying on one overhead picture to make the claim that this is a place where poisons were being developed. We have a number of sources. This is a multi-sourced piece of evidence that we put down, and we can trace things that have come out of that facility and have moved through Europe and Central Asia back into Western Europe to support terrorists in the production of poisons—poisons that have been found in different capitals throughout Europe. So this is not a [inaudible]. <BR><BR>And we fully anticipated that after my presentation, every picture I threw up and everything I showed, within a day or two the Iraqis would be taking people to go look at what they wanted them to see at these facilities. <BR><BR>Mr. Stephanopoulos: You know, you were asked about this at your hearings at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee this week by Senator [Joseph] Biden, who will also be on the program, and he raised the question, you know, why didn't you just take the terrorist camp out if you knew that they had activity there. I know you didn't want to discuss it in public, but I bring it up for two reasons: because Senator Dianne Feinstein of California says they've actually asked about it in private and haven't been given any satisfactory answers; and secondly, a senior official, intelligence official, gave <EM>The L.A. Times</EM> this explanation for why you didn't destroy it—he said this is it, this is their compelling evidence for the use of force; if you take it out, you can't use it as a justification for war. <BR><BR>Is that the reason it wasn't destroyed? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: Of course not. I do not know who this senior intelligence officer is, and he seems not to be talking intelligence but policy. We examine all of these things on a regular, continuing basis, and when you consider military options you consider them in the framework of your entire strategy. And we are familiar with this facility, we have been able to track things coming out of it, and we have a variety of options that have been under consideration with respect to that facility. <BR><BR>Mr. Stephanopoulos: Why didn't you destroy it? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: I am not going to discuss why we did or did not do a particular military action in public.</P>",True,"Iraq, WMD, chemical, biological, nuclear, FS","Saddam Hussein, George W.

I do not think it was presented as an intelligence document. It was presented as a document, a 19-page document, if my memory serves me correctly, that demonstrates how the Iraqis, over time, have deceived inspectors, have tried to send them down the wrong path. And it is a pattern that continues to this day. <BR><BR>Mr. Russert: You stand by every word? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: It is not my document. I will let the British— <BR><BR>Mr. Russert: Of your presentation? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: Oh, yes. <BR><BR>Mr. Russert: Let me show you another slide you put up, and this is the tape and how you described it: <BR><BR>""Here you see 15 munitions bunkers in yellow and red outlines. The four that are in red squares represent active chemical munitions bunkers."" <BR><BR>Mr. Russert: If we know those are active chemical bunkers, why not just send the inspectors there? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: Well, the inspectors eventually did go there, and by the time they got there, they were no longer active chemical bunkers. And if you note, I think—I do not have the pictures right in front of me, but we took the pictures before the inspectors arrived, and the second picture I showed or the third picture I showed had the inspectors arriving with more than enough notice that this was a likely place to be inspected, so that we believe, and I think the evidence shows clearly, that the Iraqis had sanitized the sites.</P>",True,"Iraq, WMD, chemical, biological, nuclear, FS","Saddam Hussein, George W.

[Resolution] 1441, which passed 15-0, with the French voting for it, <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>said that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction and they are in material breach of 16 previous resolutions</SPAN>. The French agreed to that. <BR><BR>And we said we were giving Saddam Hussein one last chance by this resolution. He has had that one last chance now for 3 months. If he does not now come into compliance and do what he is supposed to do—turn over all the documents, bring people forward for interviews—if he actually did what he was supposed to do, you would only need a handful of inspectors. <BR><BR>So more inspectors does not answer the question. And what France has to do, and what I think Germany has to do, and all the members of the Security Council have to do, is read 1441 again.

Dr. Rice, thank you so much for joining us on this very important weekend. Tom Friedman of <EM>The New York Times</EM>—Tom, we're glad to have you with us this morning. <BR><BR>Dr. Rice, let me get right to it. Iraq seems to be making new overtures to the inspectors this morning. They s—now [sic]&nbsp;suggesting they may allow U-2 flights.

Will that be enough? <BR><BR>Dr. Condoleezza Rice: We have seen this game with Iraq many times before throughout the '90s, cheat and retreat. When there's enough pressure, the Iraqis try to give just a little bit in order to release the pressure. Resolution 1441 of the U.N. Security Council said nothing about making a little progress or doing a little bit here or a little bit there. It challenged the Iraqis to comply, it challenged the Iraqis to disarm, and it did not say that Iraq—had a final chance to be inspected. It said Iraq had a final chance to finally live up to its obligations. So a little bit here and a little bit there is not going to get this done. <BR><BR>Schieffer: The president left himself very little wiggle room in the State of the Union message.

This is a matter of the last 12 years, repeated serial abuse of United Nations Security Council resolutions.

He could reverse everything that he has c—[sic] that he's been doing. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>He could show up with those mobile biological weapons laboratories that Secretary [of State Colin]&nbsp;Powell talked about.

Is that what your message is this morning? <BR><BR>Dr. Rice: Well, it's—I will—I will tell you, Bob, people are going to be very skeptical of anything that he does at this point. Because an 11th hour conversion has been his modus operandi before. He suddenly recognizes that there is a lot of pressure and he tries to do a little bit to release the pressure but the goal here is not just to continue inspections. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>The goal here is to disarm him.</SPAN> And at this point, he is in very grave danger of triggering the serious consequences that the United Nations said he would undergo if he failed to comply with 1441.",True,"Iraq, WMD, chemical, biological, nuclear, FS","Saddam Hussein, George W.

But, no, the question is, will he disarm. <BR><BR>I notice somebody said the other day, well, we need more inspectors. Well, a disarmed—a country which is disarming really needs one or two inspectors to verify the fact that they're disarming.</SPAN> We're not playing hide-and-seek.

I mean, is this geared toward pressuring Saddam into, you know, leaving office? <BR><BR>Mr. McClellan: I think it's—well, as you mentioned, obviously—and as Condi Rice and Secretary Powell mentioned, talked about yesterday on the shows, if Saddam and his cronies were to leave Iraq, that would be a positive development. But, you know, it's important for the international community and Americans to know what Saddam Hussein is doing, the type of person that he is. <BR><BR>Question: Are you preparing this proposal to give him 48-hour notice to flee Baghdad? <BR><BR>Mr. McClellan: What we are doing—and as Condi pointed out, there is a period of intensive diplomatic discussions going on as we remain in this window of diplomatic opportunity. But, again, the— <BR><BR>Question: And is that—one of those discussions? <BR><BR>Mr. McClellan: Well, I think those are discussions that will be had in consultations with Security Council members and others around the world. And I'll leave those discussions to them. I don't want to prejudge those discussions. <BR><BR>Question: You'd support that idea? <BR><BR>Mr. McClellan: Well, what we're focused on—and, remember, it goes back to what the president said over the weekend. And this is about disarmament. This is about 12 years of deceiving and denying and cheating and retreating and playing hide-and-seek. And those games are over. And the president has made that very clear. And now this is an opportunity for the United Nations Security Council and the United Nations to show its relevance; 1441 is very clear in what it says. And Saddam Hussein has continued his defiance of the international community. And this is a moment for the Security Council to come together and show its relevance.

699,2003-02-11,White House Press Briefing by Ari Fleischer,"Question: Ari, given—on this bin Laden message—and to some extent we understand that it will deal with some comments or an address he would make to the Iraqi people about their condition, if that's correct, what does the president conclude about that? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Well, based on what Secretary Powell has said, it gives rise to concern about the ties between Al Qaeda and Iraq. <BR><BR>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Question: Yes, on that same point, on the bin Laden tape, if I remember correctly, Secretary Powell said—<A href=""http://www.state.gov/secretary/former/powell/remarks/2003/17620.htm"">made a reference to the fact that the tape</A>, according to his information, was going to say from this person who purports to be bin Laden that he is in partnership with Iraq. If, indeed, that is the phrase that this individual uses, what does the U.S. make of such a statement? And how is that likely to play into the U.N. debate? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer:<SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED> Just as I indicated earlier, it gives great concern about the fact that Iraq and Al Qaeda are working together.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Question: You already had that concern. This would seem to confirm, if, indeed, this person is bin Laden, would seem to confirm what the administration has been claiming. <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>That's correct. I think when Secretary Powell went to New York and talked about the evidence we have of ties between Iraq and Al Qaeda, he did so on the basis of knowledge, on the basis of fact. And he would not have said it if he didn't mean it and if the United States government and others around the world didn't have cause to know. And so what the Secretary has alluded to this morning gives further proof of the concerns that we have about Iraq and Al Qaeda linking up.</SPAN> <BR><BR>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Question: Two things. According to the current <EM>Business Week,</EM> the Congress—estimated that tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians were killed in result of the first Gulf War. In a poll yesterday, it shows that 54 percent of Americans are opposed to the upcoming war in Iraq if it means thousands of Iraqi civilian deaths. So the question is, what is the administration's estimate of Iraqi civilian deaths in the upcoming war? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: I'm not aware of any estimates. I will say to you that every step would be taken to protect civilian and innocent life. The greatest risk to civilian life, of course, comes from Saddam Hussein, who has shown that he is willing to kill his own people with chemical weapons, that he is willing to put his own people in harm's way as human shields, and that the greater threat that the president also has to concern himself with is that the civilians who would be killed would be Americans as a result of Saddam Hussein carrying out an attack either directly or through terrorist organizations that he links up with. That's what's on the president's mind, as well, Russell. <BR><BR>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Question: The question is this: President Bush has said that Jesus Christ is his favorite political philosopher. He said that during the campaign. Jesus Christ said, turn the other cheek. He said, the meek will inherit the Earth. And he said, do violence to no man. How does the president square his militarism with Jesus Christ's pacifism? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: One, I think your choice of words is inappropriate when you refer to President Bush's militarism. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>The president is seeking a way to provide peace and to protect the American people from a growing, gathering threat at the hands of Saddam Hussein and the weapons he has collected.</SPAN> And the president approaches this matter per his constitutional duties. His constitutional duties are to be the commander-in-chief who is sworn to uphold the Constitution and protect the American people from threats to our lives. And that's the manner in which he approaches it. He does view this also as a matter of great morality in terms of the serious judgment that any president has to make about risking lives to safe life. And that's the focus that the president brings. <BR><BR>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Question: Ari, it was very clear before we got the first U.N. resolution that the president didn't believe that Saddam Hussein was ever going to disarm himself. So given that, why when we went for the first U.N. resolution did we not try to get a U.N. inspection system that was not about verification but was about disarmament? And what I mean by that is a system by which air strikes were authorized on places where we thought things were being transferred out? That U-2 spy planes began flying with the realization that any shot fired on them would immediately be a cause for war? So what I mean is use that process if we're trying to avoid war as a legitimate way to disarm and not just verify? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Well, one, the name of UNMOVIC [United Nations Monitoring, Verification, and Inspection Commission] in and of itself is verification. That's part of—that's the V in the UNMOVIC. And while they're called inspectors, I think it's also fair to call them verifiers. That is their task—to go there to verify that disarmament has taken place, not to inspect around the country with a magnifying glass trying to find something that's very hard to find. <BR><BR>Question: So you believe they could not have been disarmers? There's no way that the process could even set up to allow that to happen? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: No, the disarmer is Saddam Hussein. That's what he was called on to do. <BR><BR>Question: Ari, does the president see any merit, whatsoever, in the French and German plan for more inspectors and more time? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: The reason I think that the so-called plan, which has yet to be formally offered by a few nations, has met with significant resistance is because it—to secure the peace, it is not a question of how many inspectors are inside Iraq; it is not a question of whether the U-2 is flying or not. To secure the peace, it's a question of whether or not Saddam Hussein is cooperating. If Saddam Hussein is giving the runaround to 108 inspectors, why does anybody think he won't give the runaround to 216 inspectors. <BR><BR>The very fact that people think a U-2 needs to fly is proof perfect that Saddam Hussein is not cooperating. If he was disarming, you wouldn't need a U-2 to see it. You'd only need one or two inspectors in a parking lot to watch the weapons be rolled out. So the very arguments they make underscore the contention from those around the world who are worried that Saddam Hussein is indeed not disarming. <BR><BR>Question: So there will be no meeting them halfway. <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: I think the United States has made clear that those proposals are off the mark, do not address disarmament, and are non-starters.",True,"Iraq, WMD, chemical, biological, nuclear, Al Qaeda, FS","Saddam Hussein, George W.

701,2003-02-12,"Secretary of State Colin Powell, Testimony Before the House International Relations Committee","First, with respect to Iraq. Mr. Chairman, when the international community came together after President Bush's speech to the United Nations on the 12th of September, it came together with the certain understanding that if the United Nations was going to remain relevant it had to act on this challenge that had been put before the United Nations by Saddam Hussein, the challenge that had been put before the United Nations for the previous 12 years. And through 16 resolutions, the United Nations had demanded compliance by Saddam Hussein of his obligations under those resolutions and he ignored the United Nations. <BR><BR>The president went to the United Nations because this was a problem, as you noted, sir, not just for the United States, but for the whole world. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Saddam Hussein is a threat to his own people, he is a threat to his neighbors, and ultimately he will be a threat to the whole world with the development of weapons of mass destruction. This was not a charge dreamed up by the United States of America.</SPAN> It was a statement of the Security Council of the United Nations, repeated year after year after year. And what the president said to them on the 12th of September, it's time to get serious and put action to the words. <BR><BR>Over the next seven and a half weeks, I worked with my colleagues in the Security Council and we came up with a strong resolution, Resolution 1441, which was passed on the 8th of November. This resolution did several things, which sometimes people forget, and some of the people who voted for the resolution forget. <BR><BR>First and foremost, it said Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi regime are guilty. It isn't a matter of needing more evidence. They have been found guilty previously. They are guilty now. They remain in material breach of their obligations under previous resolutions. So there is no question about whether they are guilty or not. And every member voting that day understood that simple proposition. <BR><BR>Second, we said there is a way to resolve this to the Iraqi regime. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>There is a way to get out of this problem that you have put yourself in, and that way is to comply, to give up your weapons of mass destruction;</SPAN> to turn over the documents; to make people available to be interviewed, scientists and engineers, to bring them out of the country so they won't be intimidated; to show us where these facilities are; to bring forth all that you have been doing. And that is what the resolution called for Iraq to do. To help you, we will strengthen the inspection system and give more authority to Dr. Blix and Dr. ElBaradei in order to help Iraq comply. <BR><BR>And then finally, to make sure that Iraq understood the seriousness of this issue, the final part of the resolution clearly said that if there are new material breaches, further material breaches, meaning Iraq has not complied as it must, then serious consequences will flow. <BR><BR>Every member sitting in the Council that day and all of their capitals understood that serious consequences meant if Iraq did not take this last chance, this last opportunity to come into compliance, they would face military force in order to bring them into compliance, in order to disarm them. There was no confusion in that Council that day, I can assure you, because we worked on that document for seven and a half weeks. <BR><BR>We now have three months of experience under that resolution, and Saddam Hussein has not complied. He sent forward a false declaration 30 days after the resolution was enacted—one day short of 30 days. And in that declaration, he gave us a lot of smoke. We specifically put that in there as an early requirement, a 30-day requirement, in order to test, in order to test him to see whether or not he was going to seriously undertake his obligations. He failed the test. Nobody can dispute that. He has also failed to give the inspectors the kind of cooperation that is needed for the inspectors to do their work. I don't think there is any dispute about that and we will hear more about this from Dr. Blix and Dr. ElBaradei on Friday. <BR><BR>So we are reaching a moment of truth with respect to this resolution and whether it meant anything or not. We are reaching a moment of truth with respect to the relevance of the United Nations Security Council to impose its will on a nation such as Iraq, which has ignored the will of the Council for the last 12 years, and we are reaching a moment of truth as to whether or not this matter will resolve peacefully or will be resolved by military conflict.",True,"Iraq, WMD, chemical, biological, nuclear, FS","Saddam Hussein, George W.

And it's characterized by the pervasiveness of these technologies of weapons of mass destruction, such that they are available and they are being developed in terrorist states, and the terrorist states have relationships with terrorist networks.

703,2003-02-12,White House Press Briefing by Ari Fleischer,"<P>Question: Ari, a philosophical question, if I may, that our editors would like us to ask the administration today—in a variety of venues. Something that the critics of this administration have said both domestically and abroad when it comes to Iraq is that they still do not understand the need not only to go to war, but to go to war now to disarm Iraq and Saddam Hussein. Not just, why war, but why war now. </P>  <P>Mr. Fleischer: Why has Saddam failed to comply now? Why, when the United Nations, understanding full well the seriousness with which President Bush made his presentation last September, did the United Nations pass a resolution—binding on Iraq—that called for full and immediate compliance. The United Nations, the world, didn't say “lengthy compliance.” They didn't say “negotiable compliance.” They didn't say “compliance over months.” They said “immediate.” The words “immediate” have value and meaning if international efforts to stop proliferation are themselves to have meaning. The United Nations said without conditions or restrictions. The United Nations said it was a final opportunity—not a penultimate opportunity, but a final opportunity. The United Nations, as I indicated, said it was binding. And they said that Iraq would face serious consequences as a result of continued violations. <BR><BR>So the question is in reverse. Given the fact that Saddam Hussein has shown no inclination that he intends to comply, at what point does the world say, the United Nations has meaning, the United Nations has value, the resolutions count? <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Or is the message of the world to allow Saddam Hussein to continue to drag his feet as he builds up his weapons of mass destruction for the possibility of using them. That's a chance we don't want to talk</SPAN> [sic]. <BR><BR>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Question: What is the administration's assessment of the likelihood of the risk that Saddam Hussein with his back up against the wall with war seeming almost inevitable, will open up his arsenal of germs and chemicals and disperse them to terrorists? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Does this mean that ABC News is acknowledging that Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction? <BR><BR>Question: We just report the facts and the fact says the U.N.— <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: I'm raising that for a reason, because there's been suggestions that the United States has not made—carried out—has no proof that he has these weapons of mass destruction. And, clearly, if the questions shift— <BR><BR>Question: At </EM>ABC News</EM>? Can you identify when and where? (Laughter.) <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>I will be happy to provide you with transcripts where the administration claims that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction, that the administration does have proof that they have weapons of mass destruction.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Question: What is the administration's assessment of the likelihood— <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: I'm a transcript collector from way back.</P>  <P>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Question: So is the president, then, confident that whatever arsenal exists in Iraq can be completely and effectively neutralized by his course of action, rather than dispersed by the violence and chaos of war? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: I think you could rest assured that in the event that the president makes a determination that the use of force would be required, <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>we have made crystal-clear that this is about disarmament as well as regime change, and that part of disarmament will be to make certain that neither Saddam Hussein, nor any of the people who would follow Saddam Hussein, would ever be able to use weapons of mass destruction.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Question: Ari, you suggested before that the United States is not interested in allowing a lengthy process of compliance with the existing U.N. resolution. Does that mean that the United States would preclude a second resolution that calls for some additional weeks or months of intensified inspections? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Well, given the fact that several weeks ago the president said, this is a matter of weeks, not months, I think the timetable remains locked in at what the president said. But I think if you want to take a look at this in terms of the United Nations, United Nations resolutions, and Iraqi compliance, what you have is, unfortunately, in 2003, history repeating itself to the period of 1996. <BR><BR>And I have a document—I'll be happy to release this to you—about the fact that Iraq has not complied, they cover up their compliance in seeming efforts to comply, such as their statements about unconditional U-2 flights, which we now know from the letter that was sent by the Iraqis, so-called conditional became—so-called unconditional became conditional as soon as the ink was dry on their letter. It was never unconditional to begin with; it always had conditions attached. <BR><BR>Back to 1996. If you recall, in March of 1996, UNSCOM [United Nations Special Commission] began a program of intrusive inspections after a 1995 defection of a family member of Saddam Hussein. The defection revealed the tremendous amount of information that Saddam Hussein had previously denied he ever had—ala the declaration of 2002 where Saddam Hussein denied he had weapons. That was followed by a series of new inspections, provoking another statement by the president of the Security Council condemning Iraq's actions, which led on June 19, 1996, the request of the Security Council, UNSCOM's head travel to Baghdad and gave Baghdad what they called the last chance to avoid enforcement actions. <BR><BR>The United States consulted with allies to gain consensus that Iraq's actions were a material breach of its obligations. Military preparations begun back in 1996. On June 22, 1996, Iraq tried to cut a deal, and they did. They negotiated three agreements, a joint statement committing Iraq to provide immediate, unconditional access; a program of work that could lead to a report that Iraq had disarmed; an agreement on modalities for inspecting sensitive sites. The council then relieved itself of its enforcement actions. As we all know, that turned out to be worthless and the inspectors were shortly thereafter, in 1998, thrown out of the country. <BR><BR>A similar pattern is repeating itself in 2003. Under pressure, Iraq comes up with phony examples of compliance, trying to get leaders around the world to bite on whether or not they have indeed made a concession or started anew to comply. They hope that the world will fall for it and accept it as new evidence of progress or a concession or a negotiated development. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>All the while, it's a repeat of the pattern where Iraq continues its weapons build-up, it continues to not comply with the inspectors, hoping that this time they can get away with it.</SPAN> <BR><BR>And that's why 1441 was so significant because it said final chance. <BR><BR>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Question: Can I follow on Iraq, please? After Friday's U.N. resolution of the U.S. and U.N. meetings that are going on and resolution on enforcing the new resolution, do you think President Bush is ready to give Saddam Hussein 48 hours ultimatum to leave Iraq, if nothing happens at the U.N.? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Just as I indicated to Dick, the timetable that the president set several weeks ago is weeks, not months, and I'm not prepared to go beyond that timetable. <BR><BR>Question: One on Iraq and one on North Korea. The German government today said that it finds the tape of bin Laden disturbing and sobering, but it says there's absolutely no proof in that tape of any connection between bin Laden and the government of Iraq, just statements of support for the Iraqi people if there's a war. Is that proof that you have a tough sell still? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer:<SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED> Well, I think it just shows that Germany, which is unalterably opposed to the use of force, will still be in denial about Osama bin Laden's links to Iraq. Given the fact, especially as Secretary Powell demonstrated that we know that there are operatives of Al Qaeda operating inside Baghdad, and now we have an exhortation from Osama bin Laden on this tape to people inside Iraq—as he calls them, the Mujahideen brotherhood, or brothers—this is more proof that not only are there ties at the operational level, but now if you are operating inside Iraq and you hear Osama bin Laden exhorting you onward, your message is, as Osama bin Laden said in the tape, himself, Mujahideen brothers, he said, so it is the duty of all Muslims, particularly in Iraq, to roll up their sleeves and prepare for Jihad. And he said, it will not hurt under these circumstances if the interests of Muslims will meet with the socialists in fighting the crusaders. The socialist he refers to is Saddam Hussein. <BR><BR>So it's incomprehensible in its denial for anybody to interpret the phrase, it will not hurt under these circumstances if the interests of the Muslims will meet with the socialists in fighting the crusaders. The interests of the Muslims meet with Saddam Hussein, that is linkage.</SPAN> <BR><BR>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Question: Ari, back to France. Do you see any areas of common ground between the U.S. and the French position? Do you think Chirac has kept open certain options that Germany has already foreclosed? And, specifically, do you see any promise in the proposal that the French are circulating at the United Nations in the last 24 hours? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Well, one, we remain in mid-diplomacy here. And I'm not going to venture in too deep on the play-by-play of diplomatic discussions. Suffice it to say, when the president said that we will go to the United Nations for a second resolution so long as it enforces Resolution 1441, he said it because he does believe in the importance of the United Nations as an institution and that this is also the United Nations' last chance to show that international proliferation regimes have meaning, have effect, and are not just documents to be ignored. And so, therefore, it is important to continue to talk to our allies at the United Nations, and that's what you're seeing develop as we speak. Vis-à-vis the proposal to double the number of inspectors or to fly the U-2, again I draw your attention to the fact that already this should be unconditional on Iraq. There should not have been any question of negotiating the U-2 with Iraq; Iraq should have allowed the U-2 to fly under Resolution 1441. <BR><BR>Negotiations did ensue with Iraq. Iraq then came out and said, just over the weekend, they would allow the U-2 to fly unconditionally. Before the ink was even dry on the Iraqi letter, we found out there were conditions attached to flying the U-2 once again. As for the number of inspectors, <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>if Iraq was serious about disarming, you would need half the number of inspectors, you wouldn't need double. If Saddam Hussein has no intention of disarming, doubling the inspectors just means there are double number of people for Saddam Hussein to deceive.</SPAN></P>",True,"Iraq, WMD, chemical, biological, nuclear, Al Qaeda, FS","Saddam Hussein, George W.

707,2003-02-14,White House Press Briefing by Ari Fleischer,"<P>Question: When would you expect the U.S. to submit a resolution to the U.N. for action for authorizing the use of military force? Does [U.N. weapons inspector Hans] Blix's statement today change the timing in the U.S. view? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: As for Mr. Blix's statement today, I think it's worth analyzing exactly what he said, which is what the fundamental issue comes down to again. If you accept the premise that it's not about the process matters, whether the U-2 flies or anything else, <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>it's about whether Saddam Hussein disarms</SPAN>—examine carefully Mr. Blix's own words. Mr. Blix reported to the world today that the issues of anthrax, nerve agent, VX, and long-range missiles deserve to be taken seriously by Iraq, rather than brushed aside. <BR><BR>Those are Mr. Blix's words about weapons that kill. Then he added in a crucial sentence: it is not the task of the inspectors to find it; it is the task of Iraq to provide it. <BR><BR>Mr. Blix continued—and these are his words when he said, it is not the task of the inspectors to find it—which is a telling statement. He continues, for the first time saying this publicly: the two declared variants of the Al Samud II missile were capable of exceeding 150 kilometers in range, the missile is therefore proscribed. <BR><BR>He continues: Iraq has declared that it has reconstituted the chambers necessary to build these missiles. These experts have confirmed that the reconstituted casting chambers could still be used to produce motors for missiles capable of ranges significantly greater than 150 kilometers. Accordingly, these chambers remain proscribed. <BR><BR>The third item that he said is proscribed are 380—380—SA II missile engines, which also are proscribed. If they're proscribed, you can ask what comes next. Under United Nations Security Council Resolution 687, which ended the Persian Gulf War, it's clear what comes next—I'm reading from 687. <BR><BR>""Iraq shall unconditionally accept the destruction, removal, or rendering harmless of all ballistic missiles with a range of greater than 150 kilometers and all related major parts and repair and production facilities."" <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>So when you listened to Mr. Blix this morning describe the very fact that the weapons that kill are, one, proven to be in the hands of Iraq in a proscribed manner, and the weapons of mass destruction that kill even more— the anthrax, the nerve agent, the VX—are unaccounted for. The world still has great cause for concern about Saddam Hussein possessing weapons.</SPAN> That's what came out of New York today.</P>  <P>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Question: And the president has been making the case that Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction, he has the means to use them, links with terrorists, including Al Qaeda. Lately, he's been talking about invoking images of September 11th. And there are some people—and I'm talking about regular, everyday Americans—who are saying, this is confusing at the very least. At the worst, perhaps it's even misleading to make that link, to invoke images of September 11th in making the case for war against Saddam Hussein. How does the administration respond? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Well, of course the image of September 11th that the president is reminding people of is that everything changed for the United States on September 11th. And I don't think there's any argument that that's an accurate statement. September 11th reminded the American people that threats that we previously thought that existed for perhaps our embassies abroad or for other nations to deal with, they're actually threats that exist on our very own soil. And what government would not shift after September 11th to recognize that additional steps need to be taken to protect the homeland, because of September 11th? <BR><BR>Jim. <BR><BR>Question: But, did— <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Jim.

Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld has a four- to five-page, typewritten catalog of risks that senior aides say he keeps in his desk drawer. He refers to it constantly, updating it with his own ideas and suggestions from senior military commanders, and discussing it with President Bush. His list includes a ""concern about Saddam Hussein using weapons of mass destruction against his own people and blaming it on us, which would fit a pattern,"" Mr. Rumsfeld said. He said the document also noted ""that he could do what he did to the Kuwaiti oil fields and explode them, detonate, in a way that lost that important revenue for the Iraqi people."" <BR><BR>That item is of particular concern to administration officials' postwar planning because they are counting on Iraqi oil revenues to help pay for rebuilding the nation. Although administration officials are no doubt concerned about the ultimate number of American casualties, they have declined to discuss the issue and it is not known how that risk figures in Mr. Rumsfeld's list. If there is one thing that haunts administration planners it is the thought of a protracted conflict, which could lead to increased casualties. ""How long will this go on?"" one senior administration official asked. ""Three days, three weeks, three months, three years?"" Even some of this official's aides winced as they contemplated the last time frame on that list. The Rumsfeld document also warns of Mr. Hussein hiding his weapons in mosques or hospitals or cultural sites, and using his citizenry or captured foreign journalists as human shields. The risks, Mr. Rumsfeld said, ""run the gamut from concerns about some of the neighboring states being attacked, concerns about the use of weapons of mass destruction against those states or against our forces in or out of Iraq.""",False,"Iraq, WMD","Donald Rumsfeld, George W.

This did not sit well with some of the Iraq opposition. It did not sit well with some of your friends who said that, you know, Iraq is not Grenada, that this reminds them of the days of the British viceroys or what not. Could you please address these concerns because you said you don't want to stay in Iraq for long time? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: Yes. It is quite the contrary. Grenada—when you have a military operation, there is going to be a military commander in charge. But how long did that military commander remain in Grenada? A very short period of time. <BR><BR>It is our desire if there is a conflict in Iraq, and we still hope one can be avoided, but if there is a conflict, then a military commander will initially be in charge; not only to run the military operation, but to make sure that right after the operation things are secure, that the people are protected, that humanitarian supplies come in. You need some central authority initially. <BR><BR>It is not our goal to destroy Iraq. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>It is our goal to remove a regime that we believe has wasted the people's treasure on weapons of mass destruction.</SPAN> So we are not going to destroy Iraq and we think once the regime has been eliminated there will be institutions that remain in place. As soon as we can, we would want to get the military commander to transfer real authority to a civilian leadership, perhaps initially of an international character as one develops a new Iraqi leadership consisting of people who are outside the country right now in the opposition, as well as those who are inside the country who are responsible and who are committed to the same values that those outside the country are. <BR><BR>I think to have a new leadership in Iraq, you have to have a combination of both. And I think all of my colleagues agree with that and I think the opposition would agree with that, so we are going into Iraq not to destroy a place, but to make it better. People worry about the negative consequences. There will be positive consequences if it is necessary to go into Iraq. <BR><BR>Question: Sir, you spoke about regime change in Iraq will probably help the United States to reshape the region.

Kuwait—did we take over Kuwait? No. Have we taken over Afghanistan? No. We gave it back to its Muslim leaders. Did we take over Kosovo when we bombed it and made it safer for the Muslim population? No. Did we take over Japan? Germany? Italy? No. <BR><BR>The United States' record is not one of imperialism. It is one of doing the job, bringing peace, restoring order, and getting a responsible government in place.

734,2003-02-20,"Secretary of State Colin Powell, Interview on BET, Town Hall Meeting","<P>Question: Hello, Secretary Powell. My name is Alexandra Kennedy (ph) from St. John's College High School. My question is: Are we invading Iraq for possession of their oil? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: No, not at all. We hope not to have to invade Iraq. President Bush and the international coalition has been doing everything possible to avoid a conflict with Iraq. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>The issue simply is getting Iraq to disarm, to get rid of its weapons of mass destruction. And the United Nations Security Council, through a resolution, a resolution called Number 1441, demanded that Iraq come into compliance with its international obligations and get rid of these weapons. <BR><BR>But it also said that if Iraq did not do this, and did not cooperate with the monitors that were sent in to help them get rid of these weapons, the inspectors, then the possibility of force had to be considered, and in the absence of compliance on the part of Iraq, then force would be used to disarm Iraq.</SPAN> <BR><BR>If it comes to that, and we hope it does not, President Bush hopes it does not, but if it does come to conflict, it would be a conflict that we would try to conduct as quickly as possible. We would not destroy Iraq. We would try to remove this regime, preserve the institutions of Iraq, give their people a better life using their oil wealth, <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>not for weapons of mass destruction,</SPAN> not to threaten their neighbors, but to build a better society for the people of Iraq. The oil would belong to the people of Iraq. The United States would not take it. It belongs to them, and under international law, as well as because of who we are, we would protect that oil and use it to benefit the people of Iraq.</P>  <P>[text omitted]&nbsp;<BR><BR>Question: Lydia. Secretary Colin Powell, how does the United States defend its position to go to war with Iraq based on failure to comply with U.N. resolutions while Israel has been receiving U.S. military and economic aid and has failed to comply with more than 30 U.N. resolutions? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: We are very deeply engaged in the Middle East peace process. My Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs is in London right now, working with United Nations representatives, European Union representatives and Russian representatives, to put together finally a roadmap of how to move forward and bring peace to the Middle East. <BR><BR>We want to see violence ended, we want to see terrorism ended, we want to see responsible leadership emerge on the Palestinian side of the equation. And at the same time, we want to see Israel help create conditions of stability in the region and create conditions so that a Palestinian state can be created. <BR><BR>President Bush is the first president to go to the United Nations and say he wants to see a state called Palestine living side by side in peace with Israel, two states that have to share this land. But we have got to end the violence, we need reform within the Palestinian community. We also know that Israel has to do something about its settlement policy. <BR><BR>So it's not as if we are ignoring these resolutions and the obligations of the parties. It's just that not every one of these situations lend themselves to the kind of potential conflict of the kind we are seeing possibly in Iraq. But hopefully, even with respect to Iraq, we hope it will be possible in the next several weeks to find a peaceful solution and not take it to war. <BR><BR>War is a last resort. War is a last option. All of us in this administration and all of our partners in the international community would rather see a peaceful resolution. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>But peaceful resolution means you have to achieve your objectives peacefully, and the objective won't be achieved unless Saddam Hussein gets rid of biological weapons, chemical weapons, his plans for nuclear weapons, the missiles to deliver them. He is the one who is at fault. He is the one who is responsible for this crisis, and not the United Nations and not the United States.</SPAN></P>  <P>[text omitted]&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR><BR>Mr. Cannon: Yes, sir. Secretary Powell, first question from BET.com comes from Adonis in Henderson, North Carolina. His question is: What will happen if it turns out Saddam Hussein and Iraq do not have weapons of mass destruction? Will President Bush continue with his war plans against Iraq or focus all his attention back on Afghanistan and finding Osama bin Laden? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: We have not taken our attention away from Afghanistan. We are still looking for Al Qaeda elements. We are still looking for Osama bin Laden, assuming that he is even alive. We don't know whether he is or he is not. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>When the U.N. passed Resolution 1441 in early November, it was with the understanding that all the members of the Security Council voting that day believed that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. That was the basis for the resolution. And the reason we all believe that was we have our own intelligence services, all those nations; but moreover, for a period of 10 years, 11 years, he had denied having these weapons even though we were able to find them and get evidence, and then he would acknowledge he had them.</SPAN> And then he created conditions in 1998 where the inspectors had to leave before they finished their work, and they left some very specific questions behind when they were forced out. What happened to the anthrax that we know you had? What happened to the botulinum toxin? What happened to the mustard gas? What happened to the missiles? <BR><BR>So it wasn't a question of the international community believing he did not have weapons of mass destruction. It's what happened to them. Where are they now? And that's what he has not accounted for and that is what is of concern to the community. <BR><BR>So the presumption is and the solemn assumption is that he does have weapons of mass destruction and the evidence supports that. And if we go in, you can be sure that our priority effort will be to go throughout the country, locate these weapons, materials, facilities, documents, and pull them all up so that the region and the world doesn't have to worry about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq any longer. <BR><BR>Mr. Bradley: Mr. Secretary, if there is war against Iraq, if Saddam Hussein is removed from power, how are we safer in this country against the threat of terrorism from Al Qaeda, Hezbollah, or other terrorist organizations? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: There are terrorist organizations that would strike America and other nations if given the chance. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>What we accomplish with the removal of weapons of mass destruction from Iraq is that these kinds of weapons would not be available to fall into the hands of terrorists or to be given to terrorists. And so I would rather be chasing an Osama bin Laden who does not have potential access to chemical or biological weapons than an Osama bin Laden that has them. We want to get him one way or the other, but I think it's in the interest of the world and our own safety and the safety of the people in the region for this source of weapons of mass destruction to be no longer there for any terrorist organization that might come along. <BR><BR>And we know that over the years, Iraq, under Saddam Hussein, has been a sponsor of terrorist activity, to include a terrorist attack against former President Bush back in the past decade. And so we know that they support terrorist organizations, have conducted terrorist acts in the past, and we don't want them to create linkages and, through those linkages, provide weapons of mass destruction training, material, expertise to other terrorist organizations.</SPAN></P>  <P>[text omitted]&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR><BR>Question: Yes, Secretary Powell, if we go to war with Iraq, once the smoke clears, what is the U.S. prepared to do to rebuild the country and the lives of those affected by the war? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: We would be leading an international coalition that has already begun stockpiling humanitarian supplies, food. We are already working with the United Nations, the European Union and other international organizations on any reconstruction that might be required. <BR><BR>We would not expect this conflict to result in a great deal of destruction of the infrastructure. In fact, many parts of Iraq right now are deprived because of the leadership that Saddam Hussein has provided for the last several decades. And so we have told all of our partners in the international coalition that if conflict comes, if it can't be avoided, we're not just going in for the conflict, but we will go in to lead an international coalition that will leave Iraq in a better place than it is now. <BR><BR>Iraq will also have an advantage that countries like Afghanistan did not have, in that Iraq has roughly $20 billion worth of oil revenue available to it — <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>money that will now be used to build the country, to help people, to educate children, to put in place health care systems, and not be used for weapons of mass destruction to threaten neighbors.</SPAN></P>  <P>[text omitted]&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR><BR>Mr. Bradley: Mr. Secretary, if Iraq allows unimpeded conversations with scientists today, if they destroy their rockets, if they allow unfettered reconnaissance flights over Iraq, does that put off the war? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: No. We need more than that. We need not just more inspectors or not just more process improvement. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>What we need is a definitive action on the part of Iraq that says, ""We understand the problem we've got. We want to get rid of these weapons of mass destruction.</SPAN> So here is what we did with the anthrax. Here is what happened to the botulinum toxin. Here are the missiles that we have. You don't have to come search for them. You don't have to look for them. We will provide all of our scientists and engineers who had anything to do with these programs for you to interview anywhere you want without any minders listening in or without taping their remarks."" <BR><BR>If Iraq were to show that level of compliance and cooperation, then we could deal with this matter. But it is not enough just to say, ""Send more inspectors in,"" or, ""Give the inspectors more time."" It is not a resolution that was talking about inspections. It was a resolution that was talking about compliance on the part of Iraq. <BR><BR>If Iraq really wanted to get out of the box on this one, they would be cooperating in every way possible. We wouldn't need more inspectors. The number of inspectors there could do the job. The problem is, so far, they have not demonstrated that spirit of cooperation, that commitment to comply with the will of the international community.

They're not finders or discoverers. What's being tested now is whether or not Saddam Hussein is going to cooperate. And it doesn't take a lot of time to determine whether or not Saddam Hussein is going to cooperate. So, once the construct of that issue is placed properly before the world, it seems to me the answer gets increasingly clear. We've now had 17 resolutions. It's been 12 years. They've tried diplomacy.

The demand by Swedish diplomat Hans Blix, contained in a letter delivered to the Iraqi government this evening, covers dozens of missiles, along with launchers and engines, which Blix told the Security Council on February 14 exceeded a 150-kilometer limit imposed by U.N. resolutions ordering Iraq's disarmament after the 1991 Persian Gulf War. The destruction of the missiles has been one of several tests for judging Iraqi cooperation that U.S. and British officials discussed for inclusion in a new resolution to be introduced to the Security Council next week. The resolution will declare that Iraq is already in violation of U.N. disarmament demands, according to U.S. and British officials, whose governments have embarked on a major diplomatic push to win the endorsement of other Security Council member governments. An Iraqi refusal to destroy the missiles would provide the most visible defiance of the inspectors by the Baghdad government since the inspections resumed in November and could significantly bolster the U.S.-British case. On the other hand, an Iraqi agreement to begin destroying the missiles could significantly undercut the British and American argument and could strengthen the position now held by a majority of Security Council members that a decision to go to war should be postponed and that inspections should be allowed to continue because Baghdad is showing signs of cooperating.

It is these programs that Iraq must come forward and let the monitors and the inspectors know the disposition of or what happened to them.</SPAN> It's not a matter of the inspectors wandering all over Iraq looking for these materials, looking for these programs. So we face the same problem that we faced at the beginning when we first put [U.N. Resolution] 1441 forward, and that is Iraq is still not complying and time is drawing to a close when the international community—<SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>the Security Council—must show its relevance by insisting that Iraq disarm or that Iraq be disarmed by a coalition of forces that will go in and do it.</SPAN></P>  <P>[text omitted]&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR><BR>Question: I'm Sato Suzuki with TV Asahi of Japan. Mr. Secretary, the people in Japan have been watching the Iraqi situation with great seriousness. Despite our government's basic support for the U.S. position on Iraq, the evidence that you presented to the Security Council has failed to convince the majority of the Japanese people that you need to go to war now. So do you have anything new, anything different, that you can present to the Japanese people, and could you please try again here today and explain to us why a war is necessary right now? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: To go to the last part of the question: A war is not necessary. It is Saddam Hussein who is putting in place conditions that will perhaps result in war. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>It is Saddam Hussein who has accumulated these horrible weapons. The presentation that I gave to the Security Council on the 5th of February was a summary of evidence that we have and it was a summary, really, of evidence that has been known for a long period of time.</SPAN> I tried to put it all together in a way that people could see it. But it is not just an idle accusation or a lack of evidence; the evidence is there. If the evidence was not there in the beginning, Resolution 1441 wouldn't have passed in the first place. If you read the resolution, the resolution begins saying that Iraq is in material breach of its obligations—remains in material breach—and for years it has been denying the truth. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>We know that they have been experimenting with weapons of mass destruction of a nuclear kind.</SPAN> We had to catch them in lies to prove that they had certain chemical facilities and chemical materials available. We had to catch them in a lie to show back in the mid-nineties that they had biological materials—they were working with anthrax and boutulinum toxin. All of these have a singular purpose, and that is to destroy large numbers of human beings. So this evidence is not new evidence. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>What more evidence does one need? We know they have this material. This issue before us is they have not accounted for the material—they won't tell us what has happened to it. We have evidence that, and I tried to put forward some of that evidence on the 5th of February, that this material remains within Iraq—and we must assume it is there until they can demonstrate to us that it's not there.</SPAN> <BR><BR>If they were serious about disarmament—and this is right to the Japanese people— if Iraq was serious about disarmament, if they were not trying to deceive us as they have for the past twelve years, they would be doing everything in their power to bring forth all the documentation, all the information, let us interview anybody that we wanted to interview, and interview them anywhere that we wanted to interview them to make sure they were not being intimated. If Iraq was serious, they would be showing us where all the missiles are and not wondering whether the inspectors would find something or not find something. If Iraq was serious, this matter could be over in a short period of time. We would see full cooperation. If I was in the position of Saddam Hussein and I was trying to persuade the United Nations that I had no weapons of mass destruction, you would not have to ask me to bring forward scientists and engineers. I would bring them all forward; I'd line them all up in front of UNMOVIC [United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission] headquarters and say: ""Here they are. Take them anywhere you want. Ask them any questions you want. We will have nobody minding them. We will have no tape recorders so that we could get retribution later. Go take them and find out all you want. What documents do you need? We will bring back documents from all the places we've sent them in the homes of scientists."" <BR><BR>We would not see this continued pattern of deception, which has not changed in twelve years. And it's time for us to stop saying, ""Well, gosh, give us new evidence."" The evidence is there. The evidence is clear. The evidence has been there for these past dozen years, and especially we have evidence up to 1998 when they threw out the inspectors. And so, it is not enough any longer to say, ""We don't want to take action because we don't see enough evidence or more evidence."" It is time to take action. The evidence has been clear. They are guilty; 1441 says they are guilty, and 1441 said if they don't fix this, if they don't comply now, if they don't cooperate now, then serious consequences must flow. We are reaching that point, where serious consequences must flow. <BR><BR>Question: Mr. Secretary, from CBS News. You know, just following up that question for a moment, after 9/11, the whole world turned to us and said, ""We're Americans like you,"" including the French. Last weekend we saw the largest series of antiwar, anti-American protests—in London certainly in its entire history. This follows what you have talked about at the Security Council; it follows what's happened with the inspectors; it follows what's happening in Iraq. There seems to be a disconnect, I guess, between what America believes it should do, and what the rest of the world is perceiving. And I wonder why that is and if it isn't just a touch frustrating for you, since you're the man who is presenting and preparing this policy, and you've stood in front of the Security Council and tried to convince the world. <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: Yeah, I would prefer it if there were rallies saying that Iraq must disarm, but I have also seen previous situations in my professional career where on the eve of potential conflict there was a strong outpouring of support against that conflict. Nobody wants to see conflict. And when conflict is potentially in the near future, there will always be an outpouring that says, ""Isn't there some other way?"" I wish there were some other way. I have worked hard throughout my career to find ways other than conflict to solve problems, but sometimes you can't avoid it, and you must continue to do what you believe is the correct thing to do and the correct policy, even in the presence of demonstrations. People are free to demonstrate, and they don't see the danger the way we see the danger. We've studied this information for years. We've studied the evidence for years, and we continue to see Iraqi deception, Iraqi diversion of inspectors, Iraqi efforts to hide, Iraqi efforts to confuse. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>And all that does is persuade us that they continue to have these weapons and they are trying to hang onto them, and they have lost none of their intention to develop these kinds of weapons.</SPAN> And even though it might not be in all places the most popular thing to do, there are a number of world leaders who have stood up—such as [British] Prime Minister Blair, such as Mr. Aznar of Spain, Mr. Berlusconi of Italy—a number of leaders who have stood up in many, many nations of Europe. Yes, there is public resistance in Europe and elsewhere. It's a difficult call for many people, but these leaders are standing up because they know they don't want to wonder a couple of years from now, when Iraq suddenly pops out and demonstrates in a way that can convince everybody that they had these weapons. They don't want to be in the position, and President Bush has made this clear—he doesn't want to be in the position of saying, ""Why didn't we do something about this when we had mobilized the whole world?""</P>",True,"chemical, biological, nuclear, Iraq, WMD, FS","Colin Powell, George W.

Peacefully if possible, but by force if necessary.

Over the past few weeks you have had frequent contact with Mr. Tang Jiaxuan. I wonder how the United States makes sure that China's interests will not be harmed in Iraq after the war against Saddam Hussein. <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: Yes, I have had quite a number of opportunities to meet with Minister Tang. We have been doing everything we can to avoid a war. We have been using the United Nations, both the United States and China and other members of the Security Council. We're working hard to see if we can get Iraq to comply and avoid a war and there is still time to avoid a war. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>We must not be afraid of a conflict, if a conflict is what it takes to remove weapons of mass destruction from Iraq.</SPAN> We are not talking to any of our friends and colleagues about ""slicing up the pie"" so to speak after the conflict. If there is a conflict and the United States leads a coalition into Iraq, everything we do during that conflict and after that conflict will be for the purpose of providing a better life for the Iraqi people. And with respect to such issues as oil and their other natural assets, those assets belong to the Iraqi people and everything we do would preserve those assets and make sure they serve the Iraqi people and not anyone else. And so, I am sure that China shares that same point of view if a conflict comes, but China is working just as hard as the United States to see if such a conflict can be avoided. But the Security Council must meet its responsibilities if Iraq does not comply. That was the clear intent of U.N. Resolution 1441 when it was passed in November. We now have four months of experience, almost, with that resolution, and so far Iraq continues to play games, continues to deceive, continues to let out a little bit here, a little bit there, but has not answered the basic questions: What happened to the anthrax? Where is the botulism toxin? What have you done with the missiles? Why aren't you getting us the documents that are needed? Why can't people be interviewed without having minders and tape recorders present? Stop the game. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>But the game continues because that is Saddam Hussein's intent, to try to hang onto these weapons of mass destruction, and that must not be allowed. That was the clear intent of Resolution 1441.

746,2003-02-24,White House Press Briefing by Ari Fleischer,"<P>Question: The U.N. weapons inspectors have determined that Iraq has this missile which exceeds limits that it agreed to, or were imposed on it by the U.N. Hans Blix has said it should be destroyed. If Iraq destroys those missiles, why isn't that concrete progress toward disarmament? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Well, number one, we expect that Saddam Hussein will destroy those missiles. The United Nations Security Council has called on it to do so, and unless he engages in further defiance, we expect that he will. But, number two, as the president said over the weekend, that would just be the tip of the iceberg. And the reason for that is when a criminal holds a gun to your head and takes one bullet out of the chamber, you still have to worry about all the rest of the bullets in the chamber, because they can kill you, too. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>And the fact is, with Saddam Hussein, he still has not shown the world that he has disarmed from the VX, the nerve agents, the botulin, the anthrax, all of which the United Nations found that he had in his possession in the late 1990s, which he has yet to account for. That's the fear about what's in the rest of the gun, in the other chamber—in the chamber in the gun.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Question: So there's no way that Iraq can do anything, really, to avoid war? Because if they begin to dismantle their weapons, the president still believes that they've got other bullets in the chamber and is— <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Under Security Council Resolution 1441, which was passed in November last year, <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Iraq had an obligation to immediately and fully disarm from all the weapons that were prohibited— and I just cited several of them.</SPAN> So if Iraq were to take one missile out of the chamber that they left in the chamber—VX, sarin, botulin, anthrax—the world still has a lot to worry about.</P>  <P>Question: If you—as far as war is concerned with Iraq—if you can go inside the president's mind, he must be really tremendous—under pressure from every side and also the most tense person in the world today. When he sees all these demonstrations, like millions against him—and thousands in favoring with him, how does he feel about this? And where can he go from here? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Well, it's an interesting question. But I think as many of the people—particularly reporters who knew the president from the campaign and who have been up close with him know, there is something about President Bush that when he makes up his mind about something, he demonstrates leadership and acts on principle and is very comfortable with the actions and decisions that he makes. And that's the zone that the president is in. <BR><BR>The president believes very strongly in the importance of consultation and working with our allies. And he believes very strongly in the need to lead. And that's what he's doing. And when he looks at what has happened in Iraq, when he looks at the threat Saddam Hussein can present to the American people—particularly after September 11th—the president is certain that what he is doing and the path that he has chosen to protect the peace. And that's his approach.</P>",True,"chemical, biological, nuclear, WMD, Iraq, FS","Ari Fleischer, George W.

They stand in material breach. His choice—choices, plural. One is to cooperate and he hasn't done it. We wish he would.

It then said that Iraq stands, as of that moment, in material breach. It asked for a declaration of their weapons of mass destruction and said that if it was not a complete declaration they would stand in further material breach. They did not submit an appropriate full declaration. And they then said that if they did not cooperate with the inspectors they would be in further material breach. <BR><BR>And then it said that in the event that it is determined that they are in further material breach that they should recognize that this was a, I believe the quote was a ""final opportunity."" This is a unanimous resolution of the United Nations. A final opportunity and that there would be serious consequences, or words of that type. <BR><BR>Now what does that mean? It means that the United Nations has decided that if 17 resolutions are ignored by Iraq that the unanimous voice of the Security Council was that at some point that final opportunity will have been missed and that serious consequences would result.

More than 200 chemical and more than 100 biological samples have been collected at different sites. Three quarters of these have been screened using UNMOVIC's [United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission] own analytical laboratory capabilities at the Baghdad Ongoing Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Centre (BOMVIC). The results to date have been consistent with Iraq's declarations. <BR><BR>15. UNMOVIC has identified and started the destruction of approximately 50 litres of mustard declared by Iraq that had been placed under UNSCOM [United Nations Special Commission] supervision and seal at the Muthanna site in 1998. This process will continue. A laboratory quantity (1 litre) of thiodiglycol, a mustard precursor, which had been found at another site, has also been destroyed. </P>  <P>[text omitted]&nbsp;<BR><BR>28. In its 7 December declaration and again in its semi-annual monitoring declaration, Iraq declared the development and production of two types of surface-to-surface missiles, which, according to the data presented, were capable of surpassing the range limit imposed on Iraq by Security Council resolution 687 (1991) and had indeed done so in a number of tests. Iraq also declared the acquisition of a large number of surface-to-air missile engines for use, after appropriate modification, in the production of these missiles. This import violates the arms embargo established by the Council in paragraph 24 of resolution 687 (1991). <BR><BR>29. UNMOVIC staff have evaluated and assessed these missile projects—the Al Samoud 2 and the Al Fatah. It has also sought the assessment of a panel of international experts on the matter. To that end, a meeting took place on 10-11 February at United Nations Headquarters with experts from China, France, Germany, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Ukraine, and the United States of America. The Russian expert nominated was unable to attend. <BR><BR>30. As a result of these assessments, it was concluded that all variants of the Al Samoud 2 missile were inherently capable of ranges of more than 150 kilometres and were therefore proscribed weapons systems. </P>  <P>[text omitted]&nbsp;<BR><BR>40. On 16 January, UNMOVIC chemical experts inspecting the Al Ukhaidhir military stores, discovered a number of empty 122-mm chemical munitions.

Following this discovery, Iraq appointed a commission of inquiry to undertake an investigation and comprehensive search for similar cases at all locations.

These six munitions will also be destroyed. </P>  <P>[text omitted]&nbsp;<BR><BR>43. On 21 and 25 February, Iraq informed UNMOVIC that two complete R-400 aerial bombs (one of which had liquid contents), plus remnants of what it states were 118 R-400 bombs, had been excavated at Azzizziyah, the declared unilateral destruction site of BW-filled aerial bombs, along with some related components and remnants of other destroyed munitions.

France, on the other hand, called Iraq's pledge to start dismantling the missiles a symbol of the progress made by Mr. Blix's inspection team on disarming Iraq. But within the Bush administration, the missiles are also a symbol of a different kind. They epitomize what senior officials say is the box in which the United States finds itself when it comes to enforcing the Security Council's resolutions. Much of the administration's frustration is directed not at Mr. Hussein, but at Mr. Blix. <BR><BR>""The inspections have turned out to be a trap,"" a senior administration official said. ""They have become a false measure of disarmament in the eyes of people. We're not counting on Blix to do much of anything for us."" Not too long ago, the Bush administration had hoped that Mr. Blix would aggressively carry out inspections in Iraq and then report with absolute clarity on whether Iraq was complying with demands that Mr. Hussein disclose and destroy his weapons.

There is every hope in the administration that the votes for such a resolution can be obtained, but decreasing hope that Mr. Blix will be a help in rounding them up. On Friday [February 28], for example, Mr. Blix issued a report declaring that Iraq ""could have made greater efforts"" to locate banned weapons or to present ""credible evidence"" that they had been destroyed. ""The results in terms of disarmament have been very limited so far,"" his report said. But the report also cites some steps taken by Iraq ""under the heading of cooperation on process,"" including permission to let surveillance planes fly over the country, pleasing advocates of more inspections. A senior administration official said Mr. Blix was now more interested in pleasing all sides than stating the facts. ""Blix is a very nice man who does not want to go back to Sweden and be the cause of a war,"" said this official. ""That fact is distorting what he should be doing.""

And why have you given us no matrix by which to measure what this disarmament would look like? <BR><BR>Mr. Fleischer: Well, here's the Catch-22 that Saddam Hussein has put himself in: he denied he had these weapons, and then he destroys things he says he never had. If he lies about never having them, how can you trust him when he says he has destroyed them? How do you know he's not lying, he doesn't have tons more buried under the sand somewhere else? How do you know this is not the mother of all distractions, diversions, so the world looks in one place while he buries them in another? <BR><BR>And this is the point to which Saddam Hussein has brought himself as a result of defying the U.N., having created an environment where the inspectors were removed in the late 1990s.

We have been waiting for 12 years for him to disarm.</SPAN> We've been waiting almost four months since Resolution 1441 passed and we still are not seeing a level of cooperation and we're not seeing the compliance that the international community had hoped for. So time is running out. <BR><BR>Ms. Borger: Is there anything you realistically believe can happen to avoid war? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: Sure, if he really demonstrated that he was going to totally comply and not just wait until the pressure was on him, and he destroys a few missiles, he gives a few more documents. This is all a game he's playing, trying to satisfy the pressure that's being placed on him. <BR><BR>But the level of cooperation we've seen recently is not because he has made a strategic decision to comply, <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>but because there are five American aircraft carriers in the region and thousands upon thousands of troops are assembling to disarm him if he doesn't disarm.</SPAN> So he's trying to divert that pressure through these techniques and tactics. <BR><BR>But if he were serious, what we wanted to see after 1441 was here are the documents, here's the evidence, here's what I did, I'm going to destroy this, I'm going to show you everything, you can interview anybody you want to interview, you can interview them in the country, out of the country; <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>I have a made a strategic choice to disarm.

He looked at one of the photos and he said, based on his information, he didn't reach the same judgment. That doesn't mean I was wrong.

And so the question of how much longer the inspections should continue, do you need more inspectors, do they need more technical assistance, you can double or triple the number. And by the way, the inspectors have not asked for more inspectors. They think they have enough inspectors.

The world needs him to answer a single question: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Has the Iraqi regime fully and unconditionally disarmed, as required by Resolution 1441, or has it not?</SPAN> <BR><BR>Iraq's dictator has made a public show of producing and destroying a few missiles—missiles that violate the restrictions set out more than 10 years ago. Yet, our intelligence shows that even as he is destroying these few missiles, he has ordered the continued production of the very same type of missiles. Iraqi operatives continue to hide biological and chemical agents to avoid detection by inspectors. In some cases, these materials have been moved to different locations every 12 to 24 hours, or placed in vehicles that are in residential neighborhoods.</SPAN> <BR><BR>We know from multiple intelligence sources that Iraqi weapons scientists continue to be threatened with harm should they cooperate with U.N. inspectors. Scientists are required by Iraqi intelligence to wear concealed recording devices during interviews, and hotels where interviews take place are bugged by the regime. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>These are not the actions of a regime that is disarming. These are the actions of a regime engaged in a willful charade. These are the actions of a regime that systematically and deliberately is defying the world. If the Iraqi regime were disarming, we would know it, because we would see it. Iraq's weapons would be presented to inspectors, and the world would witness their destruction. Instead, with the world demanding disarmament, and more than 200,000 troops positioned near his country, Saddam Hussein's response is to produce a few weapons for show, while he hides the rest and builds even more. </SPAN><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Inspection teams do not need more time, or more personnel. All they need is what they have never received—the full cooperation of the Iraqi regime. Token gestures are not acceptable. The only acceptable outcome is the one already defined by a unanimous vote of the Security Council—total disarmament. <BR><BR>Saddam Hussein has a long history of reckless aggression and terrible crimes. He possesses weapons of terror. He provides funding and training and safe haven to terrorists—terrorists who would willingly use weapons of mass destruction against America and other peace-loving countries. Saddam Hussein and his weapons are a direct threat to this country, to our people, and to all free people. <BR><BR>If the world fails to confront the threat posed by the Iraqi regime, refusing to use force, even as a last resort, free nations would assume immense and unacceptable risks. The attacks of September the 11th, 2001 showed what the enemies of America did with four airplanes. We will not wait to see what terrorists or terrorist states could do with weapons of mass destruction. <BR><BR>We are determined to confront threats wherever they arise. I will not leave the American people at the mercy of the Iraqi dictator and his weapons.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Question: Mr. President, you have, and your top advisers—notably, Secretary of State [Colin] Powell—have repeatedly said that we have shared with our allies all the current, up-to-date intelligence information that proves the imminence of the threat we face from Saddam Hussein, and that they have been sharing their intelligence with us, as well. If all these nations, all of them our normal allies, have access to the same intelligence information, why is it that they are reluctant to think that the threat is so real, so imminent that we need to move to the brink of war now? <BR><BR>And in relation to that, today, the British Foreign Minister, Jack Straw, suggested at the U.N. that it might be time to look at amending the resolution, perhaps with an eye towards a timetable like that proposed by the Canadians some two weeks ago, that would set a firm deadline to give Saddam Hussein a little bit of time to come clean. And also, obviously, that would give you a little bit of a chance to build more support within the members of the Security Council. Is that something that the governments should be pursuing at the U.N. right now? <BR><BR>The President: We, of course, are consulting with our allies at the United Nations. But I meant what I said, this is the last phase of diplomacy. A little bit more time? Saddam Hussein has had 12 years to disarm. He is deceiving people. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>This is what's important for our fellow citizens to realize; that if he really intended to disarm, like the world has asked him to do, we would know whether he was disarming. He's trying to buy time. </SPAN>I can understand why—he's been successful with these tactics for 12 years. <BR><BR>Saddam Hussein is a threat to our nation. September the 11th changed the strategic thinking, at least, as far as I was concerned, for how to protect our country. My job is to protect the American people. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>It used to be that we could think that you could contain a person like Saddam Hussein, that oceans would protect us from his type of terror. September the 11th should say to the American people that we're now a battlefield, that weapons of mass destruction in the hands of a terrorist organization could be deployed here at home. <BR><BR>So, therefore, I think the threat is real. And so do a lot of other people in my government. And since I believe the threat is real, and since my most important job is to protect the security of the American people, that's precisely what we'll do. <BR><BR>Our demands are that Saddam Hussein disarm. We hope he does. We have worked with the international community to convince him to disarm. If he doesn't disarm, we'll disarm him.</SPAN> <BR><BR>He's a master at deception. He has no intention of disarming—otherwise, we would have known. There's a lot of talk about inspectors. It really would have taken a handful of inspectors to determine whether he was disarming—they could have showed up at a parking lot and he could have brought his weapons and destroyed them. That's not what he chose to do. <BR><BR>Secondly, I make my decisions based upon the oath I took, the one I just described to you. I believe Saddam Hussein is a threat—is a threat to the American people. He's a threat to people in his neighborhood. He's also a threat to the Iraqi people. <BR><BR>One of the things we love in America is freedom. If I may, I'd like to remind you what I said at the State of the Union: liberty is not America's gift to the world, it is God's gift to each and every person. And that's what I believe. I believe that when we see totalitarianism, that we must deal with it. We don't have to do it always militarily.

785,2003-03-07,"Remarks by Secretary of State Colin Powell, U.N. Security Council Meeting","We meet today, it seems to me, with one question and one very, very important question before us: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Has the Iraqi regime made the fundamental, strategic and political decision to comply with the United Nations Security Council resolutions and to rid itself of all of its weapons of mass destruction, all of the infrastructure for the development of weapons of mass destruction?</SPAN> I was pleased to hear from both of these distinguished gentlemen that there has been continuing progress on process, and even some new activity with respect to substance. But I was sorry to learn that all of this still is coming in a grudging manner, that Iraq is still refusing to offer what was called for by [Resolution] 1441: immediate, active and unconditional cooperation. Not later, immediate; not passive, active; not conditional, unconditional in every respect. <BR><BR>Unfortunately, in my judgment, despite some of the progress that has been mentioned, I still find what I have heard this morning a catalog still of non-cooperation. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>If Iraq genuinely wanted to disarm, we would not have to be worrying about setting up means of looking for mobile biological units or any units of that kind.</SPAN> They would be presented to us. We would not need an extensive program to search for and look for underground facilities that we know exist. The very fact that we must make these requests seems to me to show that Iraq is still not cooperating. <BR><BR>The inspectors should not have to look under every rock, go to every crossroad, peer into every cave for evidence, for proof. And we must not allow Iraq to shift the burden of proof onto the inspectors. Nor can we return to the failed bargain of Resolution 1284, which offered partial relief for partial disclosure. 1441 requires full and immediate compliance, and we must hold Iraq to its terms. <BR><BR>And I know these are not toothpicks, but real missiles, but the problem was we don't know how many missiles there are, how many toothpicks there are. We don't know whether or not the infrastructure to make more has been identified and broken up. And we have evidence that shows that the infrastructure to make more missiles continues to remain within Iraq and has not yet been identified and destroyed. <BR><BR>There is still much more to do. And frankly, it will not be possible to do that which we need to do unless we get the full and immediate kind of cooperation that 1441 and all previous resolutions demanded. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>The intent of the Iraqi regime to keep from turning over all of its weapons of mass destruction, seems to me, has not changed and not to cooperate with the international community in the manner intended by 1441. <BR><BR>If Iraq had made that strategic decision to disarm, cooperation would be voluntary, even enthusiastic, not coerced, not pressured.

Nuclear Inspector Says Documents on Purchases Were Forged,"A key piece of evidence linking Iraq to a nuclear weapons program appears to have been fabricated, the United Nations' chief nuclear inspector said yesterday in a report that called into question U.S. and British claims about Iraq's secret nuclear ambitions. Documents that purportedly showed Iraqi officials shopping for uranium in Africa two years ago were deemed ""not authentic"" after careful scrutiny by U.N. and independent experts, Mohamed ElBaradei, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), told the U.N.

But I will have to wait and see. We'll all have to wait and see. </P>  <P>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Mr. Russert: Your testimony before the United Nations has now been directly challenged by members at the United Nations. This is what the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, said, that, ""In recent months, the administration and Britain have alleged Iraq illegally sought high-strength aluminum tubes for a centrifuge-based uranium enrichment program and had sough uranium from Niger."" He said experts had concluded the tubes were for a rocket engine program, as Iraq had said, and that documents used to allege the connection between Iraq and Niger were fabricated. Overall, he concluded there is no evidence that Iraq has revived a nuclear weapons program. <BR><BR>Mr. El Baradei saying that you and the president misled the world on the aluminum tubes and that the documents, in terms of Niger and Iraq, were fabricated. Those are very serious charges. <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: Well, with respect to the aluminum tubes, we still believe the case is out. The CIA has done a great deal of analysis on those tubes. They are not persuaded they were just for rockets. And, in fact, another nation this week, a European nation, came forward with some additional information that still, I think, leaves it an open question as to what the purpose of those tubes was. <BR><BR>With respect to the uranium, it was the information that we had. We provided it. If that information is inaccurate, fine. We're continuing to examine this issue. And as Dr. ElBaradei said, it's still an open issue to be looked at. <BR><BR>But we have to be a little careful about nuclear weapons programs. We saw the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] almost give Iraq a clean bill of health in the early '90s, only to discover that they had a robust nuclear weapons program that they had not discovered. And if you just look at Iran this week, right now, the IAEA is discovering, as a result of information and intelligence made available, that Iran has a far more robust program for the development of nuclear weapons than the IAEA thought. <BR><BR>So while I respect Dr. El Baradei's opinion, he's a very dedicated international civil servant, I think we have to keep an open book on this as more information comes forward. <BR><BR>Mr. Russert: Another rationale provided by the administration for action against Saddam is his connection to Al Qaeda. Tom Friedman, in <EM>The New York Times</EM>, wrote this: <BR><BR>""I am also very troubled by the way Bush officials have tried to justify this war on the grounds that Saddam is allied with Osama bin Laden, or will be soon. There is simply no proof of that, and every time I hear them repeat it, I think of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution from the Vietnam times. You don't take the country to war on the wings of a lie."" <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>I don't think it's a lie. I think there is information and evidence that there are connections. We have talked about Mr. [Abu Musab] al-Zarqawi and some of the people who are in Baghdad who are linked with Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden and who were there with the certain knowledge of the Iraqi regime. We have seen connections and we are continuing to pursue those connections. <BR><BR>We are not resting our whole case on this linkage. We are resting our case for the necessity perhaps of going to war on the fact that Saddam Hussein has developed weapons of mass destruction, has them in his possession, and for 12 years he has violated the will of the international community. It is the international community that has been violated here, not Saddam Hussein. He is the one who has stuck his finger in the eye of the international community. He is the one who has been deceiving and telling the lies all these years. And the fact that there is also an Al Qaeda connection, I think certainly adds to the case, but we are not resting the whole case on that connection.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Mr. Russert: And for us to succeed in terms of our policy towards Iraq, one, Iraq must be disarmed of weapons of mass destruction; and Saddam Hussein must go? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: I think the region would be a lot better off, and certainly the Iraqi people would be a lot better off, if Saddam Hussein were no longer there. We have said clearly, though, that within the U.N. context it was getting rid of the weapons of mass destruction. It was the previous administration, President Clinton's administration, and the American Congress in 1998 that made it an American position that regime change seemed to be the only way to get rid of the weapons of mass destruction and to get Saddam Hussein out of the place so that the Iraqi people would no longer suffer under that kind of leadership. <BR><BR>What we have said is: Can the regime change itself? Can there be a changed regime, if it was the full force and pressure, political pressure of the U.N. and the threat of force? And what we have seen so far is that regime has not yet indicated it would change itself, and time is running out.

The United States, the administration, decided to go before the United Nations and seek ratification of a series of policies designed to get Saddam Hussein to disarm. During that time, the president's ratings have slipped precipitously in the United States. Our polls show that his ratings have gone from 77 percent to 55 percent in the course of just one year. In addition, European nations that were singing our praises after September 11th, now are demonstrating in the streets. So what have we gained? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: What we gained by going to the United Nations was Resolution 1441, which was unanimously approved by the Security Council, that said Saddam Hussein is guilty and there's only one way for him to get out of that state of guilt, and that's to come clean immediately, unconditionally, without any reservations, or he'd face serious consequences.

Many people in the world, unfortunately, don't see the danger as clearly as I think we do, the Brits do, the Spaniards do, the Australians do, so many others do.

And it's going to be very unfortunate if the U.N. uses 1441 as a way to wiggle away from their responsibilities, as opposed to step up to their responsibilities. <BR><BR>Mr. Snow: Is that not what Hans Blix has done already? In his testimony the other day—and you caught this—he switched from talking about Resolution 1441 to Resolution to Resolution 1284, which was negotiated some time ago and is considerably weaker, he changed the goal posts, did he not? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: Well, he tried to shift to 1284, and he is operating under 1284. Hans Blix is a decent, honest man, and nobody made 1284 go away. But 1441 said immediately, unconditional, now. 1284 was a more deliberate process, partial results for partial progress. Interestingly, France delayed 1284 for seven months and then abstained from voting for 1284. <BR><BR>And so, you know, it's kind of curious to find myself in this position where France has been against active efforts to disarm Saddam Hussein, <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>and I was hoping that with their support of 1441, which took seven weeks to achieve, they now have understood that disarmament must come, and 1441 was a means for that disarmament if Iraq didn't comply, not a means to kick the can down the street longer and allow Saddam Hussein to achieve his objective, which is to stretch this out long enough so that we lose interest, we go away, the troops go home, and nothing has changed with respect to his desire to have these weapons.</SPAN>",True,"Iraq, nuclear, chemical, biological, WMD, FS","Hans Blix, Colin Powell, Saddam Hussein, George W.

Why not let them have a few more months? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: Because Iraq continues to deceive, Iraq continues to find ways to divert the inspections. They are providing them some level of passive cooperation and there are obviously some things that are going on. But what is causing these things to be going on on the part of the Iraqis? Is it the inspection process or is it just the presence of military force? And Iraq is trying to do as little as it can to remove that political pressure and that military pressure so they can go right back to the old ways. <BR><BR>Look what Saddam Hussein said yesterday. He started placing demands on the United Nations. He wants the sanctions gone right away. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>He wants to be free again to continue with his original intent, and that was to develop weapons of mass destruction. I haven't seen that strategic change of direction on the part of Iraq and on the part of Saddam Hussein.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Dr. Blix, while he did give a report that describes some of the cooperation that he has experience, and Dr. [Mohamed] El Baradei the same thing, he also handed out a document close to 200 pages long that lists page after page of unanswered questions about the most deadly things one could imagine—anthrax, botulinum toxin, mustard gas bombs, RPVs that are being developed that have just now turned up. <BR><BR>Mr. Blitzer: So are you saying that if you gave him a few more months, three, four five months, even while you surrounded Iraq, even while the inspectors are there, during that period there would be an imminent potential threat to U.S. interests? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: I think that there is a threat to U.S. interests, there's a threat to stability in that part of the world, and with the post-9/11 nexus between countries such as Iraq that develop weapons of mass destruction and terrorists who are trying to acquire them, I think the world just cannot sit back. <BR><BR>And what he's really trying to do is to stretch this out until the troops can't stay there any longer and they go home, and he has not fully complied at that point and he is quite sure that the will of the international community will be broken at that point. <BR><BR>And so the international community came together on the 8th of November with [Resolution] 1441 and said he's guilty, he's got to now fix this, he's got to come into full, immediate, unconditional — not conditional, not later—and also active cooperation, not passive cooperation. We still haven't seen that and we must not be deceived by these limited steps that he's taking. <BR><BR>Mr. Blitzer: Well, Dr. Blix suggested that he has seen some active cooperation. I want you to listen to what he told the U.N. Security Council on Friday. Listen to this: <BR><BR>""The destruction undertaken constitutes a substantial measure of disarmament, indeed, the first since the middle of the 1990s. We are not watching the breaking of toothpicks. Lethal weapons are being destroyed."" <BR><BR>Almost 50 al-Samoud II missiles, potentially with chemical-biological warheads. They could kill a lot of U.S. troops. <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: They could kill a lot of people, and I'm glad that they're being destroyed. I just don't know how many there are and we don't know where the infrastructure may be to produce more of them. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>And so I don't view this as a definitive statement of Iraq's change of position with respect to giving up its weapons of mass destruction. And how did it come about that these weapons are being destroyed? Only grudgingly, only when the U.N. placed a demand, and only when Saddam Hussein realized that he had better start destroying these because the Security Council was liable to be no longer deceived by his efforts and there was the possibility of a war.</SPAN> <BR><BR>So this is grudging response.

The reconfigured rocket warheads appear to be cobbled together from Iraq's stockpiles of imported or home-built weapons, some which Iraq had used with both conventional and chemical warheads. Iraq contends that it has destroyed all its old chemical warheads, a claim that the inspectors have not verified. An American official who described the weapon said it was discovered in the last few months, since the United Nations inspectors returned to Iraq in November. At first, he said, Iraq told the inspectors that it was designed as a conventional cluster bomb, which would scatter explosive submunitions over its target, and not as a chemical weapon. A few days later, he said, the Iraqis conceded that some might have been configured as chemical weapons. The distinctive appearance of the rockets' cluster munitions, heavy metal balls with holes in them, suggested their use as a way to disperse chemical or biological weapons, said the official. ""If you take the kinds of fuses we know they have, and you screw them in there, when these things come out from the main frame and they explode inward, chemical agents come out,"" he said. </P>  <P>[text omitted]<BR><BR>American officials said the discovery showed that Iraq could not be trusted to cooperate with the inspectors.

So this will remain an international action—just the United Nations will have chosen to put itself on the sidelines—that is, the United Nations Security Council will have. <BR><BR>So Saddam will be disarmed by an international group.</SPAN> But from a moral point of view, as the world witnessed in Rwanda, and as the world witnessed in Kosovo, the United Nations Security Council will have failed to act once again.

Behind the scenes, however, President Bush telephoned around the world to try to build support for a new Security Council resolution authorizing force if Iraq fails to disarm by March 17. But that effort was complicated by a declaration by President Jacques Chirac of France that ""whatever the circumstances, France will vote no."" He stated unequivocally that he would veto any new resolution opening the way to war. Russia, also a veto-wielding permanent member of the Council, echoed that view. Fearing defeat in the Security Council, Britain—apparently with the Bush administration's reluctant acquiescence—raced to offer compromises that might induce uncommitted Council members to vote in favor of military action. Chief among them is the listing of specific disarmament ""benchmarks"" that Saddam Hussein, Iraq's leader, would have to meet to avoid war.

805,2003-03-10,Iran's Nuclear Program Speeds Ahead; 'Startling' Progress Poses Challenge to Bush Administration,"<P>Near the town of Natanz in central Iran, 160 newly minted centrifuges stand in neat rows inside a nuclear complex that the United States and other countries were surprised to learn about only seven months ago. The machines have been tested and judged fully operational, senior Bush administration officials say. Sometime this year they will begin spinning hot uranium gas into nuclear fuel. In a nearby building, workers are assembling parts for 1,000 more centrifuges, part of a constellation of 5,000 machines that will be linked together in a vast uranium enrichment plant now under construction. When the project is completed in 2005, Iran will be capable of producing enough enriched uranium for several nuclear bombs each year. Details about the Natanz complex are beginning to trickle out following the first visit to the site by officials from the United Nations late last month. U.S. officials who were briefed on the visit described Iran's progress last week as ""startling"" and ""eye-opening,"" so much so that intelligence agencies are being forced to dramatically shorten estimates for when Iran may acquire nuclear weapons. But equally striking is the extent to which Iran's breakthrough caught the United States and others by surprise. For a decade, U.S. efforts to keep nuclear weapons away from Iran focused on a location far to the south, a nuclear power plant being built with Russian help near the port city of Bushehr. Fearing that Iran would extract plutonium from the reactor's fuel for a nuclear weapon, U.S. officials have imposed sanctions against Russian companies and exerted enormous pressure on Russia, China and Ukraine to prevent them from supplying the project with sensitive equipment and know-how. </P>  <P>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Iran's acknowledgment of its uranium enrichment program last month signaled a shift in the country's nuclear strategy, one that complicates the U.S. response.

In the weeks after 9/11, you argued with the principals that Iraq shouldn't be top of the threat list, that Saddam wasn't going anywhere and that, in fact pursuing Iraq may even break up the coalition against terror. Obviously, the president decided something else after, Afghan style. What changed things for you? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: It wasn't weeks after, it was at that very next Saturday that we debated this in front of the president, as has been well reported and recorded, and the president decided in that first week that we had to go after the enemy that had just struck us. And it was Osama bin Laden, it was Al Qaeda, and then when the Taliban wouldn't turn him over, it became the Taliban. And he announced that to the nation the following Thursday, if I'm not mistaken—that nine days in there. <BR><BR>So it was a decision that was pretty straightforward and, I thought, rather obvious. But a case was made, as you well know, and it was a very legitimate case, that there are other terrorist organizations and there are nations that are havens and support the terrorist groups, such as Afghanistan was. And this is all presented to the president. These weren't revelations. We all knew this. We had been worrying about Iraq since we came in here. <BR><BR>And the debate that we had was should we go after Iraq at the same time as Afghanistan. I argued that Afghanistan, everybody will understand, Al Qaeda everybody will understand. We've got several thousand dead Americans and 80 other nations—or it's 90 now—nations of casualties. And we pulled everybody together behind this, NATO [North Atlantic Treaty Organization], the U.N., OIC [Organization of the Islamic Conference], you name it, they were all behind us in this. This is what the American people are expecting. Let's do this and we can take care of the others in due course. <BR><BR>Would we have gone after Iraq if there hadn't been a 9/11 at that time? No. And so should 9/11, in and of itself have been the precipitating reason to go after Iraq? No. Did it change the prism through which we viewed Iraq? Yes, definitely. And that's why the president said we'll look at this in I think he said the next phase, or subsequent phases. And so we did that. <BR><BR>Meanwhile, however, we finished work on smart sanctions, which was a year's worth of work, but we finally got them. The Pentagon kept reviewing its plans, kept waiting to see whether we had changed attitudes on the part of Saddam Hussein, and there was none. And so in the course of last spring and summer, as we debated this, as we got Afghanistan not fixed but up and running, [President Hamid] Karzai is there, we have an interim authority, we are starting to do other things on the war on terrorism, Abu Sayyaf. We work with a number of countries around the world, Yemen and other places, and we realize the comprehensive nature of the assault that will be required, going after financial systems, intelligence systems. You know all that; I won't belabor it. <BR><BR>Question: Right. <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: And then, finally, what about these other countries that are a problem, the nexus between weapons of mass destruction and terrorist organizations. So, naturally, we have turned our attention to Iraq. As we looked at Iraq and realized how we were fighting a war against terror through a terrific coalition, it seemed—to me, anyway—that we would want something approaching that level of support if we were going to do Iraq. We needed people who would be in on this. <BR><BR>And we discussed this and debated this through the summer. And I think definitely what happened in August, and the president made the decision in August to go to the U.N. in September. I wasn't expecting as exciting an August as it turned out to be, because he had decided it the first week of August that he was going to do that on the 12th of September. Which was a given, because we knew he was going to the U.N. He was going to speak on something on the 12th of September, and this had become the pressing issue of the day. You all were writing about nothing else even then. <BR><BR>Question: Exactly. Nothing's changed. (Laughter.) <BR><BR>But people like [General] Tony Zinni have said, you know, Iraq still isn't the biggest threat facing America. Again, has your opinion of the threat really changed that much? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>My opinion has always been that Iraq is a dangerous country, it's a dangerous regime. It is developing weapons of mass destruction. And it was something that had to be dealt with sooner or later. It was always on our agenda. It moved up and down the agenda, depending on what else was going on in the world. But it was always there, lurking.</SPAN> <BR><BR>And so the post-9/11 period highlighted it in a way that it hadn't been highlighted before with this potential nexus. Does it mean that they're coming after us tomorrow morning? No, but this is clearly a guy who never changed his fundamental intent and has never modified his decision to pursue these kinds of technologies, these kinds of weapons. And, you know, some people have been committed to that proposition since the very beginning, when I was out of the government. <BR><BR>And so the approach that I took to it was that we should try to get as much support for this as we can and we should work to give the Iraqis one more opportunity to change their mind, and to realize a better life awaited the Iraqi people, and perhaps some form of survival for the regime. It would have to be a different regime, a changed regime from the one we talked about, which got us into all those tautologies about regime change and change in regime.",True,"Iraq, WMD, Al Qaeda, FS","Colin Powell, George W.

818,2003-03-15,Radio Address by President Bush,"Good morning. This weekend marks a bitter anniversary for the people of Iraq. Fifteen years ago, Saddam Hussein's regime ordered a chemical weapons attack on a village in Iraq called Halabja. With that single order, the regime killed thousands of Iraq's Kurdish citizens. Whole families died while trying to flee clouds of nerve and mustard agents descending from the sky. Many who managed to survive still suffer from cancer, blindness, respiratory diseases, miscarriages, and severe birth defects among their children. <BR><BR>The chemical attack on Halabja—just one of 40 targeted at Iraq's own people—provided a glimpse of the crimes Saddam Hussein is willing to commit, and the kind of threat he now presents to the entire world. He is among history's cruelest dictators, and he is arming himself with the world's most terrible weapons. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Recognizing this threat, the United Nations Security Council demanded that Saddam Hussein give up all his weapons of mass destruction as a condition for ending the Gulf War 12 years ago. The Security Council has repeated this demand numerous times and warned that Iraq faces serious consequences if it fails to comply. Iraq has responded with defiance, delay, and deception.</SPAN> <BR><BR>The United States, Great Britain, and Spain continue to work with fellow members of the U.N. Security Council to confront this common danger. We have seen far too many instances in the past decade—from Bosnia, to Rwanda, to Kosovo—where the failure of the Security Council to act decisively has led to tragedy. And we must recognize that some threats are so grave—and their potential consequences so terrible—that they must be removed, even if it requires military force. <BR><BR>As diplomatic efforts continue, we must never lose sight of the basic facts about the regime of Baghdad. <BR><BR>We know from recent history that Saddam Hussein is a reckless dictator who has twice invaded his neighbors without provocation—wars that led to death and suffering on a massive scale. We know from human rights groups that dissidents in Iraq are tortured, imprisoned, and sometimes just disappear; their hands, feet, and tongues are cut off; their eyes are gouged out; and female relatives are raped in their presence. <BR><BR>As the Nobel laureate and Holocaust survivor, Elie Wiesel, said this week, ""We have a moral obligation to intervene where evil is in control. Today, that place is Iraq."" <BR><BR>We know from prior weapons inspections that Saddam has failed to account for vast quantities of biological and chemical agents, including mustard agent, botulinum toxin, and sarin, capable of killing millions of people. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>We know the Iraqi regime finances and sponsors terror. And we know the regime has plans to place innocent people around military installations to act as human shields. <BR><BR>There is little reason to hope that Saddam Hussein will disarm. If force is required to disarm him, the American people can know that our armed forces have been given every tool and every resource to achieve victory.</SPAN> The people of Iraq can know that every effort will be made to spare innocent life, and to help Iraq recover from three decades of totalitarian rule. And plans are in place to provide Iraqis with massive amounts of food, as well as medicine and other essential supplies, in the event of hostilities. <BR><BR>Crucial days lie ahead for the free nations of the world. Governments are now showing whether their stated commitments to liberty and security are words alone—or convictions they're prepared to act upon. And for the government of the United States and the coalition we lead, there is no doubt: we will confront a growing danger, to protect ourselves, to remove a patron and protector of terror, and to keep the peace of the world. <BR><BR>Thank you for listening.",True,"chemical, biological, Iraq, WMD, FS","George W.

820,2003-03-16,"Vice President Dick Cheney, Interview on NBC's <EM>Meet the Press</EM>","Mr. Tim Russert: What could Saddam Hussein do to stop war? <BR><BR>Vice President Cheney: Well, the difficulty here is it's—he's clearly rejected, up till now, all efforts, time after time after time. And we have had 12 years and some 17 resolutions now. Each step along the way he had the opportunity to do what he was called upon to do by the U.N. Security Council. Each time he has rejected it. I'm not sure now, no matter what he said, that anyone would believe him. We have, Tim, been down this effort now for six months at the U.N. with the enactment of 1441. We asked <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>for a declaration of all of his WMD [weapons of mass destruction] come clean. He refused to do that. He's, again, continued to do everything he could to thwart the inspectors.</SPAN> <BR><BR>I'm hard-put to specify what it is he could do with credibility at this stage that would alter the outcome. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>He's always had the option of coming clean, of complying with the resolution, of giving up all of his weapons of mass destruction,</SPAN> of making his scientists available without fear of retribution, turning over the anthrax, and the VX nerve agent, and the sarin, and of the other capabilities he has developed, and he has consistently refused. And if he were to sit here today and say, ""OK, now I'll do it,"" I'm not sure anybody would think that had credibility. <BR><BR>Mr. Russert: If he did come forward and say, you know, ""The British laid out six benchmarks. I have decided to turn a new leaf. Here's the VX, here's the mustard gas, here's the anthrax, here's all the records. I will go on television, denounce weapons of mass destruction, you can take any scientists you want out of Iraq, all I ask is that I can stay here in power."" <BR><BR>Vice President Cheney: Well, I think we are at the point where—it's hard for me to conceive of him doing that. And pure speculation that he might do such a thing. And, of course, the problem we have is what we have seen in the past is that even on those occasions after the '91 Gulf War when we did strip him of certain capabilities, when the inspectors were able to go in through the work of defectors, for example, and destroy significant capabilities that he had acquired, and that as soon as they were gone, he was right back in business again. <BR><BR>And I think that would be the fear here, that even if he were tomorrow to give everything up, if he stays in power, we have to assume that as soon as the world is looking the other way and preoccupied with other issues, he will be back again rebuilding his BW [biological weapons] and CW [chemical weapons] capabilities, and once again reconstituting his nuclear program. He has pursued nuclear weapons for over 20 years. Done absolutely everything he could to try to acquire that capability and if he were to cough up whatever he has in that regard now, even if it was complete and total, we have to assume tomorrow he would be right back in business again. <BR><BR>Mr. Russert: So bottom line, he would have to disarm completely and leave the country? <BR><BR>Vice President Cheney: I think that would be the only acceptable outcome I can think of at this point, but obviously, we can continue to try to work through the United Nations and work diplomacy to try to arrive at an acceptable outcome. To date, we haven't been successful. <BR><BR>Mr. Russert: Many Americans and many people around the world are asking one question: Why is it acceptable for the United States to lead a military attack against a nation that has not attacked the United States? What's your answer? <BR><BR>Vice President Cheney: Tim, we have, I think admittedly, a new and unique set of circumstances we're trying to deal with here. If you think back to the way we were organized in the last century, the 20th century, to deal with threats to the United States, or to our friends and allies, we had to deal with large states, significant military forces, intercontinental ballistic missiles, the kinds of threats we dealt with throughout the period of the Cold War, all of that changed on September 11 of a year and a half ago. Since that time, we've had to deal with the proposition that truly deadly weapons could be delivered to the United States by a handful of terrorists. We saw on 9/11, 19 men hijack aircraft with airline tickets and box cutters, kill 3,000 Americans in a couple of hours. That attack would pale into insignificance compared to what could happen, for example, if they had a nuclear weapon and detonated it in the middle of one of our cities, or if they had unleashed weapons of mass destruction, biological weapons of some kind, smallpox or anthrax, on a major attack on the United States. That's a whole different proposition for us to think about, how we deal with that. <BR><BR>And at the front of our concerns as we try the deal with these issues is the proposition that the Al Qaeda organization is absolutely determined to do everything they can to acquire chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons. We found ample evidence of that in the camps and the tunnels and the caves in Afghanistan. We see evidence of it in the interrogations that we have been able to do now on many of the Al Qaeda members that have been captured. We know that they have done everything they could to acquire those capabilities over the years, and we also are confident that if they ever do acquire that kind of capability, there's no doubt they'll use it. There's absolutely nothing to restrain them from doing that. <BR><BR>If you look back at our strategies that we used in the 20th century, specifically, say vis-a-vis the Soviet Union during the Cold War, we had a policy of containment, alliances, NATO [North Atlantic Treaty Organization] in particular, very successful at containing the Soviet Union, a policy of deterrence we could hold at risk, those things that they valued with our ballistic missiles and we were able to forestall a conflict throughout that whole period of time; enormously successful policy. <BR><BR>Then you look at the proposition of a handful of terrorists operating in a part of the world where they find sanctuary and safe haven in a rogue state or in an area that's not even really governed by anybody, developing these capabilities to use against the United States. And how do you apply containment to that situation? How do you deter a terrorist when there's nothing they value that they're prepared to defend, when they're prepared even to sacrifice their own lives in the effort to kill Americans and there's no piece of real estate that they value highly enough so that a concept of deterrence works. <BR><BR>We have to think new thoughts about how we deal with that threat, and so when we look at the kind of strategy we want to pursue, we do a number of things. We, obviously, want to defend the homeland, so we spend an enormous amount of time and effort trying to make it a tougher target, but we know defense isn't enough. You've got to have good offense, and we've gone aggressively after the terrorists wherever we can find them. We worked the financial circuits and the intelligence and law enforcement efforts. We've had great success there recently; Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and others. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>But we also have to address the question of where might these terrorists acquire weapons of mass destruction, chemical weapons, biological weapons, nuclear weapons? And Saddam Hussein becomes a prime suspect in that regard because of his past track record and because we know he has, in fact, developed these kinds of capabilities, chemical and biological weapons. We know he's used chemical weapons. We know he's reconstituted these programs since the Gulf War. We know he's out trying once again to produce nuclear weapons and we know that he has a long-standing relationship with various terrorist groups, including the Al Qaeda organization.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Now, if we simply sit back and operate by 20th century standards with respect to national security strategy, in terms of how we're going to deal with this, we say wait until we are hit by an identifiable attack from Iraq, the consequences could be devastating for the United States. We have to be prepared to prevent that from happening. I have argued in the past, and would again, if we had been able to pre-empt the attacks of 9/11 would we have done it? And I think absolutely. I think the American people would have supported it. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>We have to be prepared now to take the kind of bold action that's being contemplated with respect to Iraq in order to ensure that we don't get hit with a devastating attack when the terrorists' organization gets married up with a rogue state that's willing to provide it with the kinds of deadly capabilities that Saddam Hussein has developed and used over the years.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Mr. Russert: French President Jacques Chirac said this morning that perhaps there could be a deadline of 30 days or 60 days and he may be able to buy into that. What would be wrong for the United States to say to the world, ""OK. We're going to give Saddam 30 days or 60 days and put some pressure on the French to step up and have a united front against Saddam Hussein""? <BR><BR>Vice President Cheney: Well, that's exactly what we've been doing for 12 years, Tim. And that's what [Resolution] 1441 was all about, the U.N. Security Council resolution that was passed last fall. We negotiated that with the French and with the other members of the U.N. Security Council. We got a 15-to-nothing vote on it. It said that unless he came into compliance, serious consequences would follow. He clearly is not in compliance. He continues to be in material breach. We've now gone through the process that was envisioned in 1441 of extensive consultation with the other members of the U.N. Security Council, and we're approaching the point where further delay helps no one but Saddam Hussein. <BR><BR>The more time passes, the more time he's got to work on developing new capabilities—excuse me—the more time he's got to position his forces to attack or to try to mount and support terrorists operations against our forces in the region or elsewhere. We've run out this string for 12 years and 17 resolutions in the U.N. Security Council. Now, with all due respect to the French, if you look back at their track record, they have consistently opposed efforts to hold Saddam Hussein accountable for his actions. <BR><BR>Mr. Russert: Is it because of their financial dealings? <BR><BR>Vice President Cheney: I can't say that. I don't know. Excuse me. I know, for example, in '95, when there was an effort to pass a resolution, the Security Council finding him in material breach, France opposed it. In '96, when there was an effort to pass a resolution condemning Saddam Hussein for his slaughter of the Kurds, France opposed it. In '97, when there was an effort to block travel by his intelligence and military officials, France opposed it. In '98, France announced he was free of all weapons of mass destruction—something nobody believed. And in '99, of course, they opposed the creation UNMOVIC [United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission], the existing inspection regime, that they now want to place their total faith in with respect to trying to disarm Saddam Hussein. Given that pattern of behavior, it's difficult for us to believe that 30 days or 60 more days are going to change anything. <BR><BR>Mr. Russert: That's a non-starter? <BR><BR>Vice President Cheney: I think it is. <BR><BR>Mr. Russert: The <EM>Los Angeles Times</EM> wrote an editorial about the administration and its rationale for war. And let me read it to you and give you a chance to respond: ""The Bush administration's months of attempts to justify quick military action against Iraq have been confusing and unfocused. It kept giving different reasons for invasion. First, it was to disarm Hussein and get him out. Then, as allies got nervous about outside nations deciding 'regime change,' the administration for a while rightly stressed disarmament only. Next, the administration was talking about 'nation-building' and using Iraq as the cornerstone of creating democracy in the Arab/Muslim world. And that would probably mean U.S. occupation of Iraq for some unspecified time, at open-ended cost. Then, another tactic: The administration tried mightily, and failed, to show a connection between Hussein and the 9/11 perpetrators, Al Qaeda. Had there been real evidence that Hussein was behind the 9/11 attacks, Americans would have lined up in support of retaliation."" <BR><BR>What do you think is the most important rationale for going to war with Iraq? <BR><BR>Vice President Cheney: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Well, I think I've just given it, Tim, in terms of the combination of his development and use of chemical weapons, his development of biological weapons, his pursuit of nuclear weapons.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Mr. Russert: And even though the International Atomic Energy Agency said he does not have a nuclear program, we disagree? <BR><BR>Vice President Cheney: I disagree, yes. And you'll find the CIA, for example, and other key parts of our intelligence community disagree. Let's talk about the nuclear proposition for a minute. We've got, again, a long record here. It's not as though this is a fresh issue. In the late '70s, Saddam Hussein acquired nuclear reactors from the French. 1981, the Israelis took out the Osirak reactor and stopped his nuclear weapons development at the time. Throughout the '80s, he mounted a new effort. I was told when I was defense secretary before the Gulf War that he was eight to 10 years away from a nuclear weapon. And we found out after the Gulf War that he was within one or two years of having a nuclear weapon because he had a massive effort under way that involved four or five different technologies for enriching uranium to produce fissile material. <BR><BR>We know that based on intelligence that he has been very, very good at hiding these kinds of efforts. He's had years to get good at it and we know he has been absolutely devoted to trying to acquire nuclear weapons. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>And we believe he has, in fact, reconstituted nuclear weapons. I think Mr. [Mohamed] ElBaradei frankly is wrong. And I think if you look at the track record of the International Atomic Energy Agency and this kind of issue, especially where Iraq's concerned, they have consistently underestimated or missed what it was Saddam Hussein was doing.

Right now we're focusing on these leaders getting together in Lajes just to talk about the diplomatic situation and to make a judgment as to whether the diplomatic window is closing. And that's a refocusing on, it's not a war council and ultimatums are not the issue today. The issue today is has the diplomatic track run its course? <BR><BR>Mr. Snow: One diplomatic effort apparently the United States has tried is to get word to Iraq that if Saddam Hussein and certain members of his inner circle were to leave the country, they could still avert war. Are we still trying to transmit such a message to Baghdad? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: I think that's a fair statement. If Saddam Hussein, his sons, and a number of other top leaders were to leave and a more responsible leadership come in, <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>a leadership that is determined to get rid of its weapons of mass destruction as they are supposed to</SPAN> and start to provide a better life for the Iraqi people, then a war certainly could be averted. </P>  <P>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Mr. Snow: He has turned over a 25-page document to [U.N. weapons inspector] Hans Blix that purports to document the destruction of VX [nerve gas].

I don't know what Dr. Blix has made of it. I know that this is a document he was supposed to have turned over in 1991. Eleven times over the last 12 years, he has provided declarations that were supposed to be full, complete and accurate. <BR><BR>We gave him another chance with [Resolution] 1441 to declare all that he knew about these weapons, to turn it all in; and he chose not to. And suddenly, here comes another 25-page document. It's part of a continuing effort on his part to break the Council up, to deceive us, and it is a game we have been watching for 12 years. It's a game that must come to an end.</P>  <P>[text omitted]&nbsp;<BR><BR>Mr. Snow: We've talked about the French. Let me read a few quotes from Dominique de Villepin right after the passage of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1441. First he said, ""If Saddam Hussein doesn't comply, doesn't fulfill his obligations, the recourse to force will be triggered."" A second quote, and then we'll talk about both of them: ""We think,"" that is the French, ""that he might use the chemical-biological weapons, and I want to repeat here that we also suspect there's an embryonic nuclear element. We can't run that risk."" <BR><BR>That was Dominique de Villepin just back in November—just a few months ago. Now all of sudden France is saying it's going to veto everything. Why do you think that's happened? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: I'm not entirely sure because those are excellent quotes that you pulled up, Tony. It shows that there was no doubt, no question, about what 1441 was all about: compliance or the use of force if necessary. That's what the serious consequences meant in 1441. And also, you see an acknowledgment by the French foreign minister that this capability existed within Iraq for weapons of mass destruction. <BR><BR>1441 was premised on the reality that such weapons of mass destruction programs existed. It wasn't a figment of anyone's imagination, and all 15 members agreed. Now, in the months after that, France decided for its own purposes to just keep trying to avoid the inevitable conclusion that Saddam Hussein was not complying: keep inspections going, give them more time, let's have 120 days, let's do this, let's do that. And they did not want to face up to the reality that it is now time to consider whether or not the diplomatic track has run its course and it's time to use military force. <BR><BR>Mr. Snow: If the French came along and said, we would like to have a longer window, whether it would two weeks or 30 days, and then at that point force would be triggered, would the United States say okay? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: Two weeks or 30 days for what? All we need is two hours to decide whether or not Saddam Hussein has made the decision that he's been called on to make for the last 12 years, and that is a good way for him to manifest that he really wants to solve this problem is for him and his sons to pick up and leave town.</P>",True,"Iraq, chemical, biological, nuclear, WMD, FS","Colin Powell, Hans Blix, Saddam Hussein",http://www.state.gov/secretary/former/powell/remarks/2003/18751.htm,http://2001-2009.state.gov/secretary/former/powell/remarks/2003/18751.htm,"SOURCE: Colin Powell, interview on <EM>Fox News Sunday</EM>, Fox, March 16, 2003.",Colin Powell

The moment of truth is arriving. And you will hear a speech from the president of the United States this evening. President Bush will address the nation and the world on the situation as we now see it. In his speech, he clearly will issue an ultimatum to Saddam Hussein that the only way to avoid the serious consequences that were built into [U.N. Resolution] 1441 is for Saddam Hussein and his immediate cohorts to leave the country and to allow this matter to be resolved through the peaceful entry of force and not a conflict. Nevertheless, the president's determination will be made clear tonight that this matter cannot continue indefinitely, <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>that Saddam Hussein is guilty of the charges that have been brought against him previously through these many resolutions which acknowledged that he had weapons of mass destruction, and he has failed to disarm himself as required by the various resolutions.</SPAN></P>  <P>[text omitted]&nbsp;<BR><BR>I won't say any more about the president's speech because the president, of course, will have the opportunity to speak for himself and make the points perfectly clear to the American people and to the international community. <BR><BR>You will also notice that in their statements yesterday at the Atlantic Summit, all of the leaders spoke to a future for Iraq that will be brighter if it comes to the use of military force, where this dictator will no longer be able to oppress his own people, no longer able to threaten his neighbors, and no longer able to develop these horrible weapons which could be used against his neighbors as they have been used in the past, or, of greater concern to us, and spread and be acquired by terrorist organizations which might use them against us, our friends, or our interests. <BR><BR>I think it was also important to note in the president's statement yesterday his commitment to the U.N. and the role that we believe the U.N. will play in the aftermath of any conflict should it come and our continued support for the U.N. And with that, I will take a couple of questions and then I have to go. </P>  <P>[text omitted]</P>  <P>Question: Mr. Secretary, you seemed to imply yesterday in one of the shows that you believe French commercial interests helped drive the position. I am wondering if you can elaborate on that. And how firm a guarantee do you have that Turkey won't send its troops well into northern Iraq and cause problems with the Kurds there? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: I made the point that there—in response to a question, that of course there are commercial interests that everybody has to consider. And the French have for years had difficulties with the inspection regime. And I pointed out in one of the shows yesterday that when you go back to 1998 and early 1999, when the current inspection regime was being developed, when UNMOVIC [United Nations&nbsp;Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission] was being created after the collapse of the previous inspection regime, France worked actively for a number of months, in our judgment, to try to weaken that inspection regime. And, at the end of the day, when compromises had been made and everybody thought we had a good outcome before our time, the previous administration, even then France abstained from voting for it. And so that is a concern to us. <BR><BR>But, in 1441, France was solidly on board. And when you look at the statements that were made by French officials right after the passage of 1441, <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>it was absolutely clear that they understood that Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi regime had weapons of mass destruction. It was not something just known to American intelligence; it's known to all the major intelligence agencies in the world.</SPAN> And France acknowledged that, everybody acknowledged that when they signed on to 1441, because that's what it says. It said, Iraq is in material breach, has been in material breach, and now has the opportunity to get out of the problem or get into further material breach. And what they did was get into further material breach.

In a National Security Council meeting yesterday morning, Bush finalized the decision to withdraw the resolution from consideration and prepared to deliver an address to the nation that had already been written. Rather than calling doubters, he spent much of the day telephoning committed allies, including the prime ministers of Britain and Spain, who co-sponsored the U.N. measure; Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha of Bulgaria, the only other council member to support it; Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon; and Australian Prime Minister John Howard, who said Bush had asked him to send Australian troops to Iraq.",False,Iraq,"George W.

Beers, who had served twice before on the National Security staff in previous administrations and held a number of senior State Department positions, was brought on board in August after the abrupt departure of Wayne A. Downing as deputy national security adviser. </P>  <P>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Beers's abrupt departure came as the administration raised the domestic terrorism alert status and heightened security efforts around the country on the eve of the U.S. military invasion of Iraq. A White House official said yesterday that Beers left for ""personal"" reasons, and that the departure would have no effect on the administration's ability to coordinate its terrorism response. ""Somebody will step up and act in that capacity,"" the official said. A number of officials noted that Beers was one of the most experienced NSC officials. In addition to his two previous tours there, he served as assistant secretary of state for international narcotics and law enforcement and held various positions in the department's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs. He was also deputy political adviser to the supreme allied commander in Europe. Beers declined to comment yesterday, but close associates said he had considered leaving the high-pressure job for some time before submitting his one-paragraph resignation letter on Monday. Although some speculated that his resignation was a protest against the White House's increased concentration on Iraq at the expense of the overall counterterrorism effort, others cited general weariness with fighting internal battles.</P>",False,Iraq,George W.

Downing] was replaced by two people, John Gordon and Randy Beers. As with Downing, I had known Beers and Gordon for a long time, having started working with them in 1979 and 1981, respectively. Beers was a young Foreign Service officer then and Gordon was an Air Force Major. John Gordon went on to command a wing of nuclear armed missiles in Wyoming, be George Tenet's deputy at CIA, and then be the first director of the new National Nuclear Security Administration. Randy Beers and I would spend the next twenty-three years working together in the White House and the State Department, as deputy assistant secretaries, NSC [National Security Council] directors, assistant secretaries of state, and special assistants to the president. When Randy Beers went to the terrorism job in the NSC in 2002, he began working for his fourth president in the White House (having previously worked there for Reagan, Bush, and Clinton). Beers had enormous experience working on intelligence policy and operations, terrorism, foreign military operations, and law enforcement. He was the perfect man for the job. <BR><BR>Beers called from the White House months later and asked if he could stop by my house for a drink and some advice. ""Randy, since when have you started calling before you dropped by? See you in a few minutes."" We had been giving each other advice and counsel for years, but I sensed that there was something wrong, maybe there was new information about another planned Al Qaeda attack. I sat on the stoop of my old Sears catalogue house and thought back to the night twelve years earlier when I had been sitting there drinking Lagavulin and cursing the CIA for saying that Iraq would not invade Kuwait. Older now and off Scotch, I opened a bottle of Pinot Noir from a small winery I had found along the Russian River. When Beers sat down next to me his first words were, ""I think I have to quit."" <BR><BR>I thought I knew why, but I asked. His answer flowed like a river at flood: ""They still don't get it. Insteada goin' all out against Al Qaeda and eliminating our vulnerabilities at home, they wanna fuckin' invade Iraq again. We have a token U.S. military force in Afghanistan, the Taliban are regrouping, we haven't caught bin Laden, or his deputy, or the head of the Taliban. And they aren't going to send more troops to Afghanistan to catch them or to help the government in Kabul secure the country. No, they're holding back, waiting to invade Iraq. Do you know how much it will strengthen Al Qaeda and groups like that if we occupy Iraq? There's no threat to us now from Iraq, but 70 percent of the American people think Iraq attacked the Pentagon and the World Trade Center. You wanna know why? Because that's what the administration wants them to think!"" I could see that there was some considerable built-up anxiety with the Bush administration. I got another bottle of Pinot Noir. <BR><BR>Randy continued. ""Worse yet, they're using the War on Terror politically. You know that document from Karl Rove's office that someone found in the park? Remember how it said the Republicans should run for election on the war issue? Well, they did. They are doing <EM>Wag the Dog</EM>!

839,2003-03-20,"Secretary of State Colin Powell, Interview on Domestic News Syndicates","<P>Question: My question is: How is it that your motives, which you insist are so good and decent in terms of helping Iraq,&nbsp;[are] so misunderstood by so many people in the world? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: Because people are concerned about war. People naturally always have a level of anxiety. And, frankly, some motives have been attributed to us which are not accurate, that we're in it for the oil, that we're in it in order to control that part of the world, the Middle East. But as the president said last night, I think it was, and as [Secretary of Defense] Don Rumsfeld has said and I've said, we don't want to stay there a day longer than is necessary to put in place a responsible form of government, get them up and running, use their treasury for the benefit of their people, and not weapons of mass destruction and to threaten their neighbors. <BR><BR>Now, that's what we're going to be doing and I hope that as we do it and as people see how we conduct our activities, then they'll understand that the United States is not anti-Muslim, anti-Iraqi people, anti-people of the region, anti-Arab. And we'll do it well and do it in a manner that we bring credit upon the coalition forces, and I hope we'll reverse this trend. <BR><BR>What I see in this trend of anti-Americanism, as it's been described, is anti-American policies. There are some policies that people—that we have that people don't approve of. They think we should be doing more with respect to the Middle East peace process, that a different way should have been found to deal with Iraq. We tried to find a different way to deal with Iraq. We gave Iraq and the world a peaceful solution through [U.N. Resolution] 1441 and Iraq did not take it. <BR><BR>And I think between what we're going to do with the liberation of Iraq and what the president will be doing with respect to the Middle East peace plan following on his announcement last week of the roadmap and with the emergence of a new prime minister, I think we'll be able to start changing public opinion.</P>  <P>[text omitted]&nbsp;<BR><BR>Question: Well, the Powell Doctrine is up to you. You will find it in pieces of <EM>Foreign Affairs</EM> and other places (inaudible). But specifically, it's—the commanders I've talked to, it's not overwhelming force, it's a squishy exit strategy, squishy foreign support for such an operation. Criticisms like that. You obviously don't think that's fair. Tell me why this is not—do these go against the precepts you laid out (inaudible)? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: Well, first of all, it isn't a doctrine. The term Powell Doctrine was coined by one of your colleagues. I always can't remember whether it was Jeffrey Smith or Michael Gordon who did it. <BR><BR>Question: Gordon takes the credit. <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: Michael takes credit? I was explaining this all to him one day and he called it the Powell Doctrine. Fine. But I accept it. <BR><BR>Clear political objectives. I think there's a clear political objective here. <BR><BR>I don't use the term ""overwhelming force"" and never have. If you ever look at what I've said, I may have slipped once and used it at the very beginning back in 1989 or 1990, but what I've always said is decisive force. There's a nuance difference, but it's a real one. You use the force necessary to accomplish the mission. <BR><BR>And I think that the young officers that I trained that you now see in the newspapers as the commanders of the this operation clearly understand what decisive force means, and I think they will be applying decisive force. It doesn't necessarily mean huge numbers of people. It means decisive force. And I'm sure they are not going into this operation thinking that they don't have sufficient force to achieve a decisive outcome. <BR><BR>With respect to political support, I think they have political support, certainly from our leaders. It isn't universal. Not every nation, in fact many nations, think we're not doing the right thing, and many nations think we are doing the right thing. And I think as the operation unfolds and as we are successful, more and more nations will understand and give us the kind of political support that you need. <BR><BR>I have never said that you have to have political support around the world to conduct an operation. The use of the armed forces is first and fundamentally a sovereign mission conducted by a nation for principally its own interests as well as broader interests, and so you need the political support and the political objective given to you by the American people. I think this has it in this case. <BR><BR>And then exit strategy, I think you should always have some understanding of how a conflict will end and what you hope to achieve as a conflict is ending, and I think I touched on that. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Get rid of the weapons of mass destruction,</SPAN> make sure you leave a government that is responsible to its people and that is using the treasure of Iraq for the benefit of its people, restore stability in the region, keep the country one country, and not let it break up. All those, I think, are elements of how you finally turn it over to the Iraqi people and withdraw. <BR><BR>And one of the good things about doctrines is you can write it—as soon as the guy who wrote it left, you can write a new one. I mean, it's (inaudible) can't (inaudible) anybody (inaudible). <BR><BR>Question: Just for (inaudible) clarification, when the president was making his decisions last night as to what to do, were you part of that meeting? Because you weren't included in some of the press reports. That's why I wanted to know. <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: The reason I wasn't included in <EM>The New York Times</EM> account but in <EM>The Washington Post</EM> account, and I hope you will correct this, is that I think when somebody came in to see who was there, he had made the decision and I had come back over here to make phone calls.

So that has been a concern and it combines together all the things that you mentioned. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>The important point in the president's mind, and I think he's right about this, is what has justified this level of American commitment, this level of risk of American lives, is the connection between a regime that has weapons of mass terror, chemical and biological weapons and working on nuclear weapons, and that has these connections to terrorists and uses terrorism as an instrument of national policy. That is at the core of the argument.</SPAN> But to suggest, therefore, that we have no interest in also freeing the people of Iraq is wrong. As a matter of fact, one of the things that makes it possible to free us from the threat of weapons of mass terror is that the Iraqi people, I believe, are so eager to be freed from that regime that they can be our real allies.</P>",True,"chemical, biological, nuclear, Iraq, WMD, FS","Paul Wolfowitz, Saddam Hussein, George W.

860,2003-03-25,Defense Department&nbsp;Briefing by Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and General Richard Myers,"Rumsfeld: Good afternoon. It's now about five days since the major ground forces entered Iraq. It's almost four days and 30 minutes ago that the air war began. We're still, needless to say, much closer to the beginning than the end. The men and women in the uniform, the U.S. and coalition alike, are performing superbly. They're doing an outstanding job. The resistance that's being encountered was expected. It has not affected coalition progress. Iraqi forces are capitulating by the hundreds. The total now, as I understand it—at least early this morning—was something in excess of 3,500 Iraqi prisoners of war and thousands more that have been part of units that have simply disband (sic). With each passing day, the Iraqi regime is losing control over more of the country. Coalition forces are closing in on Baghdad and will not stop until that regime has been driven from power. Their defeat is certain. All that is unclear is the number of days or weeks it will take. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>The threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction will be removed and a regime that is one of the world's most notorious sponsors of terror will be no more.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Question: Mr. Secretary, as the nature of the questions before have indicated, and you yourself have anticipated, is at the first sign of any difficulty or casualties, there have been a number of critics, some of them laymen and some of them retired military officers, senior military officers, voicing the kinds of concerns that Charlie did. <BR><BR>Without again restating it, would you say that you have perhaps not adequately managed the expectations here of—in the sense that some people believe that just five days into this, the war might be going badly, and you're trying to make the point that we're much closer to the beginning than the end. Do you need to do a better job in giving the American people and the public an idea of what to expect in the days and weeks ahead? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: I don't know how to answer that, really. If you go back to the Afghanistan situation, it was only a few days into it that it was described by one of the newspapers here as a ""quagmire."" And it was a matter of days later that things looked quite good and, as I recall, Mazar-e-Sharif fell, and then the other cities began to fall. <BR><BR>I can't manage what people—civilians or retired military—want to say. And if they go on and say it enough, people will begin to believe it. It may not be true, and it may reflect more of a misunderstanding of the situation than an analysis or an assessment of it, but there's no way anyone can affect what people say. We have a free country. In Iraq, they can affect what people say because you get shot if you say something they don't like. We don't do that. <BR><BR>Question: Mr. Secretary? <BR><BR>Question: General Myers? <BR><BR>Question: Mr. Secretary? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: But it seems to me that anyone with any sense of what's taking place recognizes the complexity of this task, the importance of it; <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>the fact that we're there to eliminate the weapons of mass destruction in that country and to put in a regime that will not threaten its neighbors.</SPAN> These are important things to be done. They're not things that are done easily. This is a sizeable military that the coalition forces are up against. They are—unlike 1991, they recognize that the task is not to put them out of Kuwait and then let them go about their business; the task here is to not only deal with them throughout the country, but to see that the regime is changed.

Where do you stand on what kind of role the U.N. should play in Iraq's political future? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: The U.N. has made it clear that they do not want to be governing Iraq. Secretary General [Kofi] Annan and I have talked about this a number of times and [National Security Adviser] Dr. [Condoleezza] Rice has been up to see him. I expect to see him once I get back from this trip. <BR><BR>I am going to have to talk to all of my colleagues on Thursday and in the course of the next several days to get their individual opinions about it, but I think there is a consensus that says the United Nations has a role to play. If you look at the Azores statement and what President Bush and Prime Minister Blair said at Camp David last week, you have a solid acknowledgement from them and from President [Jose Maria] Aznar and others that there is that role for the U.N. to play. <BR><BR>What we have to work out is exactly the nature of that role and how the U.N. role will be used to provide some level of endorsement for our actions, the actions of the coalition, in Iraq for some period of time until we can switch administration over to civilian administrators on the way to a new government built up from the interim Iraqi authority. <BR><BR>We believe that early on the interim Iraqi authority should be accorded some level of recognition so that aid can flow. I think it's important for us to show as soon as we can that Iraqis now are, once again, taking charge of their country to put it on a road to a better future based on all the principles <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>you heard us espouse—getting rid of weapons of mass destruction,</SPAN> representative government, one nation, territorial integrity, and living in peace with its neighbors. And the sooner we show that in the form of an interim Iraqi authority that is working with the coalition, working with the U.N. and working with the international organizations to serve the people of Iraq, the sooner we will have the Iraqi people recognize that a new life is there for them. And we'll get the full cooperation, I hope, of the population. <BR><BR>Now, how you put that all in the form of U.N. resolutions is something we'll have to work at and it will take a great deal of discussion and negotiations. But I sense everybody understands that there will, no doubt, be debates about how much authority the U.N. should have and what the role of coalition forces should be during this interim period. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>As you've heard me say many times, I think it's pretty obvious in a campaign like this, as you bring it to a conclusion, as you succeed, as you win, the military has a role to play to stabilize the situation, disarm people that need to be disarmed, deal with the residual military force that's there, get the weapons of mass destruction.</SPAN> <BR><BR>And you can't turn that over to anyone right away, so there will be a period when the military will have that very proper and legitimate responsibility. But as the president has said on occasion—many occasions, I think—we don't want to stay one day longer or leave one day sooner than we should. <BR><BR>[text omitted]</P>  <P>Question: Mr Secretary, I know that you are confident of victory in Iraq and you're confident that once the Iraqis see this better life that awaits them that things will straighten out, but in the interim, the longer the war goes on, the more casualties among Iraqi civilians occur inadvertently, but the more that occur, how concerned are you about how that is complicating the situation in the Arab world and heating up emotions? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: We all would like to see the war brought to a speedy conclusion but wars are fought and you follow the rhythm of the battles. And what I'm seeing right now as I look at it is that everyday they are getting weaker and we are getting stronger. <BR><BR>Everyday a large number of sorties go out of all kinds and they come back having destroyed more tanks, more artillery, inflicted more casualties on the Iraqi forces. Those casualties in those forces are not being replenished. There are no new tanks coming and each day more coalition forces arrive in the theater. And now the 4th Division is well into its unloading and moving into the battle area. And so there's no doubt in my mind about the fact that we will prevail, but I cannot tell you how long it will take. That goes to the rhythm of the battles, the rhythm of the war, and the judgments that are made by the commanders on both sides. <BR><BR>But I think it's inevitable. We all hope it will be soon, because of some of the concerns that we see in the Arab Street, <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>because we want to get on with our original mission, which is get rid of the weapons of mass destruction and start to rebuild this country and society.</SPAN> I've seen these rhythms and patterns before.

A future that will be based on a new Iraq, an Iraq that is living in peace and freedom with a government that is representative of all the people, that is responsive to the needs of the people, <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>a government that will no longer be developing weapons of mass destruction or dealing in terrorism activities or brutalizing its own people; a government that will use its oil wealth for the benefit of its people and not for preparing to invade its neighbors or to develop weapons of mass destruction.</SPAN> <BR><BR>I indicated to my colleagues that the work of reconstruction and rebuilding will require the entire international community to join together. We will be going through a phase process obviously in the post-hostilities period. Initially, military commanders, the coalition commanders will be responsible for stabilizing the situation for securing the country and people, <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>for making sure that we find all the weapons of mass destruction, identify them, destroy them, pull out the infrastructure and capability, making sure that we have disarmed any remaining remnants of the Iraqi army that might be a threat to their own people or to coalition forces.</SPAN> But at the same time, that military commander is performing that job, which is his responsibility as the commander of the liberating force, we will quickly want to bring in individuals who can establish an interim Iraqi authority so that the people of Iraq can very quickly see that their own representatives are moving into positions of authority, and as the interim authority develops capability, responsibility will be passed to them to make decisions about the future of Iraq and how Iraq will be governed and how it will be led and how it will be administered.&nbsp;<BR><BR>[text omitted]&nbsp;<BR><BR>Question: When you came into office you were sort of a diplomatic star in the view of many Europeans, but in the last few months you have in the view of many Europeans but also Americans, you have become sort of a symbol of failing U.S. diplomacy.

U.S. diplomacy— <BR><BR>Question: It is not my premise (inaudible)— <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: We won't go to polls and ratings, but maybe another time.

That's why I'm here today to speak to all of my European Union colleagues and NATO colleagues about a way forward. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>The United States took a bold diplomatic step last September when President Bush went to the United Nations and presented a problem to the United Nations that one particular dictator and one particular regime that has been brutalizing its people and had been developing weapons of mass destruction for 12 years had ignored the will of the international community.</SPAN>   <P>[text omitted]&nbsp;<BR><BR>Question: Mr. Colin Powell, do you still believe in the reasons that you gave to justify the war, after two weeks with a very strong resistance from the Iraqi people and no evidence of the weapons you are looking for?

And that's been our priority. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>We have not yet started our search for weapons of mass destruction, which we know are well hidden throughout the country and within the Iraqi industrial infrastructure, but we will certainly be doing that.</SPAN> We have uncovered quite a bit of protective gear that the Iraqis have, which certainly suggested that they were prepared to fight in chemical environments—so are we, but everybody knows and the Iraqis knew that we didn't have any chemical weapons to be used in a conflict.

888,2003-04-03,"Secretary of State Colin Powell, Interview on German ZDF-TV","Question: Mr Secretary, welcome to Old Europe, as we now say. The place has changed a bit, politically speaking. This is how the term ""Old Europe"" came up. Do you feel that in your conversations the ambience is not quite the same as it used to be before the big conflict? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: It is for me. I have known all the ministers that I met today for quite a bit of time now. Especially, Joschka Fischer, my German colleague. We've been working together for two years now. We've done many things together, whether it was Afghanistan, expansion of the Alliance. We've had some disagreements recently, especially over Iraq. But an alliance as strong as ours, as resilient as ours, can deal with disagreements and move on. So, as we move on with this issue of Iraq and get beyond the conflict and into the reconstruction and the creation of a democratic Iraq that is serving its people, and not building weapons of mass destruction, whether you call it ""Old Europe"" or ""New Europe,"" the transatlantic alliance, the transatlantic family will come together again in the rebuilding process. <BR><BR>Question: There is now the big question about the U.N.'s role in the future of Iraq. We have heard the word about the ""emerging consensus."" That sounds very nice. But Germany and others clearly want to have the U.N. in the driver's seat, in control, in the leading the role. This is not what you intend, or is it? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: We don't know what the role exactly will be of the U.N. yet, and it is premature to start describing it as being a central role, or in the driver's seat, not in the driver's seat, because it suggests you are excluding someone else when you say it that way. The U.N. must be a partner in this effort. The U.N. will have a major role to play. And we will be working with our colleagues in the coalition, and our colleagues within NATO, within the European Union and especially with the secretary general, who will have something to say about this, with respect with the exact role to be played by the U.N. The role of the U.N. will ultimately be determined by the Security Council resolutions that are passed, authorizing the role. So there will be discussions and no doubt there will be debate in New York as to what authorities are required and what the role of the U.N. should be. So this is the beginning of a dialogue—not the beginning of a fight, the beginning of a dialogue—to determine what the appropriate role is. <BR><BR>But as I said, and I've said this several times, the coalition that went in, that was willing to put at risk its young men and women, and lost lives, paid a great amount of money to conduct this campaign and also paid a political price for this campaign as well. We are committed to making sure that that sacrifice and that investment is not lost. We believe we have to play a very significant, perhaps a leading role, in order to make sure what replaces this corrupt, rotten regime is a democratic system that is responsive to the needs of its people and will reflect all of the people of Iraq, <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>and will use the treasure of Iraq, its oil, to invest in the people and not invest in weapons of mass destruction.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Question: I hear what you are saying. What many people in Europe will hear, through your words, is this is how the new partition of labor will be: America is looking for its allies, is going its course with or without allies, any number that's available, and be it zero. And then the U.N.'s role is to go in as a good Samaritan and clean up the mess. That's all they can do. America is already looking at its next destination— <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: That's absurd. It's an absurd, simplistic, shorthand response to what people think we're doing. In fact, we went to the U.N. in the first place with respect to this problem. It was a problem that belonged to the U.N. for twelve years—this terrible regime that tortures its people, <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>that developed weapons of mass destruction,</SPAN> that used them against its own people and then invaded its neighbors on two occasions. And we finally said to the United Nations, ""If you would be relevant, if the international community would be relevant, we must deal with this."" <BR><BR>This is not a regime that will simply roll over and play dead. It will fight back. It will try to avoid consequences. So we got a very strong resolution passed. Unanimously. Fifteen to zero. And when it became clear to a number of members of the Security Council that it was time to apply those serious consequences, we took it back to the U.N. And the U.N. said, ""Well, can't agree on this."" <BR><BR>But 1441 made it clear—it was more than sufficient authority. Now there were some members of the Council who said, ""We'll veto anything."" And there were others of us who felt we must move forward. We must remove this danger to the world. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Especially this regime that developed weapons of mass destruction and might actually allow some of these weapons to fall in the hands of terrorists.</SPAN> We will not apologize for this. We believe that we did what is right and we recognize that there is a great deal of opinion, especially in Europe, that thinks this was not the right approach. But I hope we will change this opinion, when everybody sees that after this conflict we're not leaving it to be swept up by the United Nations. We are going to work with the United Nations and work with the international community. And guess who will be the major contributor, who will pay the most money to help the Iraqi people to get back on their feet. It will be the United States, as always.

Stop now. Immediately. Unconditionally. Without hesitation. No more fooling around. You're guilty. You're in material breach. Stop it."" And they still played games. And they tried to stretch it out. And they tried to break the will of the international community. And so we saw Operation Iraqi Freedom. <BR><BR>There is this perception in many parts of Europe, frankly, that now that the United States has done this, we're just looking around for another place to go to war. It's as if you don't know our history. We don't look for wars to go to. We do this reluctantly. You perhaps should look at European history first, for a preemptive action and nations that enjoy going to war. <BR><BR>And so we are not looking for wars to go to. We are looking for place that we can work with to solve the problem of HIV/AIDS, to solve the problem of famine, to solve the problem of economic growth, to solve the problem of sustainable growth. That's what we really want to do. But we will not turn away from those regimes that are supporting terrorist activities, not after 9/11 we won't. So we will say to the world...Syria supports terrorist activities. Iran supports terrorist activities. Iran is developing weapons of mass destruction.<BR><BR>It doesn't mean, as the night follows day, that there is going to be a war with Syria, Iran or North Korea. In fact, what has been driving me to some distraction the last couple of months, is that we've been working so hard to have a multilateral approach to North Korea, and to engage the neighbors of North Korea—China, South Korea, Russia, and Japan—in finding a solution. And the criticism I get all the time is ""Why aren't you unilaterally saying to the North Koreans, let's talk right away?""

What I'm pleased about today is that no one spoke out against such a role in the meetings that I was in. There was a willingness to consider a role for NATO in Iraq.

I think British troops are doing very well in the south, around Basra. And American troops are circling Baghdad, starting to probe into the city. So I think the campaign is going exceptionally well. It's been handled very professionally and will continue to be so. Humanitarian re-supply, I'm sure they will be talking about how to make sure that the population is taken care of, not only in the north, but in the south. <BR><BR>And I think they'll talk about the way forward. A lot of discussion about the role of the U.N., and I'm sure that will be a subject for discussion. There isn't as much debate and disagreement about this as you might read in the newspapers. Everybody knows from the Azore statement of a couple of weeks ago that there will be are [sic] role for the U.N. as a partner in this process. <BR><BR>I've spent a good part of the weekend in conversation with Kofi Annan, and I think the Secretary General may well have an announcement about that this afternoon, with respect to well, I'll let him make his announcement—with respect to how he will participate in deliberations with the coalition. <BR><BR>As we said from the very beginning—and I don't think there's any inconsistency here—when you're in a military campaign such as this, when it comes to an end, the active hostilities come to an end, the military commander must be in charge for a period of time to stabilize the country, ensure security, make sure that the military—<SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>the other side has been disarmed, find the weapons of mass destruction and make sure that humanitarian supplies are coming in.</SPAN> That is his obligation as the military commander going in.   <P>[text omitted]   <P>Question: What is the peacekeeping force? Will it be a U.N. peacekeeping force? Will it be a coalition peacekeeping force? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: We're examining what's going to be needed in the way of security or a peacekeeping force. It's not clear yet what's going to be required and when it's going to be required or where it's going to be required. It is for that reason that we are in discussions, not only with the U.N. but with NATO. <BR><BR>One of the items for discussion in Brussels last week was, is there a role for NATO. And I was very pleased that all of my NATO colleagues at the North Atlantic Council meeting we had, accepted the possibility that there may be a role for NATO organizations, <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>NATO units to go in a peacekeeping, security or stability role, perhaps helping in the search for weapons of mass destruction infrastructure.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Now, they haven't decided that or voted upon it, but nobody rejected it as a possibility. So the message that we are trying to give people, and the president has been giving the message in the Azores presentation statement, and I'm sure you will hear it coming out of this message, this statement tomorrow and the conversations over the next 24 hours, is that the hostilities phase is coming to a conclusion. It's time for all of us to think about the post-hostilities phase, how we create a representative government consisting of all elements of Iraqi society—<SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>those inside the country now who are committed to a different kind of Iraq, an Iraq that's living in peace with its neighbors; no weapons of mass destruction;</SPAN> everybody has a chance to participate in the life of the nation and the government—as well as those individual outside Iraq, the external opposition, who for all these years never lost sight of the possibility of a free Iraq. They obviously have an important role to play in the new Iraq, as well. <BR><BR>Question: When the military commander is in control—is that when you would envision a full-scale search for WMD? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Once the hostilities are over and we're not fighting battles every day, the search for weapons of mass destruction capability and infrastructure will, of course, be intensified, as you can allocate resources to it.</SPAN> We're not chasing it now. If you run into something that looks suspicious, as you know, reports come up every couple of days, we look at it. We found a lot of defensive equipment, and there are always reports surfacing about something that's out there. But that's not the mission of the troops right now. Their mission right now is to defeat the Iraqi army. <BR><BR>And so I think that the international community that I deal with recognizes it's time to look forward; [U.N. Security Resolution]1441 was a success. We had the authority that we needed from 1441—that gave us the authority.

He terrorized his nation for several decades. He threatened his neighbors. He tortured people. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>He developed weapons of mass destruction. He was a source of instability in the region.</SPAN> <BR><BR>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Sir David Frost: How important is it that we discover—I mean, there's been no definitive findings reported. How important is it that we do discover weapons of mass destruction? Would it be embarrassing if we didn't? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Well, we will find weapons of mass destruction. For the last three weeks we've been fighting battles, and once this combat period is over we can then turn our attention to finding the weapons of mass destruction. And I think they will be found. That was the basis upon which we went in, and I think there is strong evidence. There's no question about the fact that there are weapons of mass destruction, and they will be looking for them.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Sir David Frost: And if there are, they would tend to be likely to be chemical and biological, rather than nuclear, wouldn't they? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>There is, I think, a higher likelihood of there being chemical and biological weaponry. The nuclear program we also think is there, but we don't think it was as advanced as, perhaps, their chemical and biological weapons programs were.</SPAN> <BR><BR>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Sir David Frost: Can we have closure of this war without finding out what happened, or finding or capturing or killing Saddam Hussein? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: Yes. I mean, this campaign, this operation, will come to a successful end when there is a new government in Iraq that has been decided upon by the people of Iraq, not imposed by the outside forces or the coalition. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>And when the people of Iraq have foresworn any support of terrorism, when there are no more weapons of mass destruction,</SPAN> and when they are committed to using the wealth of Iraq for the benefit of the people of Iraq, and not to develop weapons or to threaten neighbors, then we will have closure, with or without Saddam Hussein. Sure, we would like to know exactly what happened to him, but he is no longer in charge of anything. If he is alive he is not going to show his face, and if he is dead we may never know. <BR><BR>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Secretary Powell: Not in this instance because it is—the Secretary General [Kofi Annan] does not yet believe he has a mandate for this. But I think in due course the United Nations will play a role. In due course we want this interim authority and we want the Iraqi government that arises from this embryo of an interim authority to be recognized in the international community, which means being recognized by the United Nations. <BR><BR>So we're not fighting the United Nations. We will be going through the United Nations for it to play its vital role in due course and with various resolutions as we move forward. <BR><BR>Sir David Frost: But at the beginning, in the period leading up to the IIA [Iraqi Interim Authority], obviously you want to be there without the U.N. and without France interfering in the search for the weapons of mass destruction, because you could argue that they have vested interests in them not being found. I mean, you don't want them there at that time. <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>We don't feel a need right now to consult with respect to the weapons of mass destruction because the campaign is still underway. When General Franks has said that hostilities are over, made that recommendation to the president, and when the country has been secured and the situation stabilized, then we will turn our attention to the search for weapons of mass destruction. And the United States and its coalition partners, the United Kingdom and other nations—there are now some five nations in Iraq now as part of the coalition right in Iraq—then we will turn our attention to looking for these weapons of mass destruction and we will see what assistance can be provided in this effort.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Sir David Frost: That's right, though you wouldn't probably want France, Germany or Russia as part of that. <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: Well, it's not a role for France, Germany, and Russia. I mean, we will be the liberating authority. We will have occupational responsibilities. But it's—<SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>I don't want to quite couch it that way because what we want to do is find these weapons of mass destruction and make sure that the whole world sees them and understands the nature of this regime. And we will want these weapons of mass destruction and the infrastructure associated with it seen by the whole world and verified by the whole world.</SPAN> <BR><BR>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Sir David Frost: And talking about the U.N., as we have been, the events since last September through to today, I mean, most people would say that obviously the U.N. has been weakened by what's gone on, maybe seriously. But seriously weakened? I mean, that's inevitable, I suppose, because of what happened. <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: I think it has been weakened. I don't think we should deny this, sort of soft-pedal it. <BR><BR>The U.N. was presented with a challenge by the president last September, and the challenge was simple: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>For 12 years you have issued instructions to Saddam Hussein via resolutions to get rid of his weapons of mass destruction, to comply, and he has ignored those instructions; so you have one last chance to give him one last chance, and if he doesn't take this last chance, you have to impose your will.</SPAN>",True,"Iraq, WMD, chemical, biological, nuclear, FS","Saddam Hussein, George W.

So that is not only a military victory, it is also a political victory. <BR><BR>However, we also picked up a responsibility, willingly picked it up, that if we were to do that there would be a period of enormous instability in the country and we had an obligation, therefore, to stay long enough to put in place a representative form of government that would hold the country together, <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>that would not be interested in weapons of mass destruction, terror or repressing its people;</SPAN> and would use the wealth of its people for the benefit of its people.</P>  <P>[text omitted]</P>  <P>Question: Mr. Secretary, in a nutshell, what exactly is the lesson that you want countries that have been seeking WMD or sponsoring terrorism to take from the Iraq war? What exactly (inaudible)? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: It's a dangerous thing to do. That the United States has made it clear that we are not going to rest until the global war on terrorism has been won. And as the president said at the very outset, if you are a terrorist or if you are a haven or a harbor for terrorists or you are helping terrorists do their evil work, you are going to be held to account when you're guilty. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Secondly, I hope the lesson that anybody developing these weapons would draw from Iraq is the most competent power of military force on the face of the earth, with an enormous ability to project power, and they have gone into war twice in the last ten years with everybody expecting that weapons of mass destruction will be used against them. We went into the war in Desert Storm expecting chemical weapons use and the possibility of biological weapons use. We went into this war the same way. So don't think that you necessarily, if war—let me drop necessarily. Don't think you have a deterrence by having weapons of mass destruction.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Now, we didn't really think Saddam Hussein had a nuke at the time of Gulf War One, but he could have. There were some who said he did. It didn't deter us. And there is nobody who can match us nuclear-wise anyway. So weapons of mass destruction do not buy you the security or the deterrence capability that you might have thought they bought you; therefore, in my judgment, ""Do you want my advice, Mr. Rogue State Leader? You're wasting your money on fool's gold, and heaven help you if your fool's gold, as you try to spin it into something useful, gets in the hands of a terrorist. You will be held accountable for that."" <BR><BR>So it seems to me that any leader who wishes to remain a leader, who does not wish to put his future at risk, looking at Iraq would suggest to them that it's time to rethink our policies. This is the message we've been giving to Syria for the last two and a half weeks that have gotten you all so excited, and hopefully it's a message Mr. [James] Kelly will convey into the North Koreans' hands.</P>",True,"Iraq, WMD, chemical, biological, nuclear, Axis of Evil, Al Qaeda, FS","Saddam Hussein, George W.

933,2003-04-23,"Secretary of State Colin Powell, Interview on BBC's Iraq Documentary","<P>Question: A bit of slightly ancient history now, I suppose, just to begin with: the aftermath of 9/11 when people first started talking about Iraq. What was your advice at that stage about what implications that event had on policy towards Iraq? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: To really put it in context, I have to take you to an earlier period, to the beginning of the administration, 2001, January of 2001, when the president came in. Iraq was on our mind then because we had been watching for the nine years after the Gulf War, 10 years after the Gulf War, an Iraq that had been kicked out of Kuwait. Kuwait had been freed, but nevertheless Iraq was not complying with the obligations it entered into as a result of ending the Gulf War. <BR><BR>Mr. Cheney, Vice President Cheney now, and Secretary of State Powell, former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, had more than a passing interest in what went on in that part of the world in Iraq. When we came in, we discovered that the sanctions regime that was being used to contain Iraq was falling apart, the Security Council was losing interest in it, they wanted to get rid of the sanctions, a number of the permanent members. We also realized that we had this no-fly zone where we were patrolling every day over the northern and southern part of Iraq, and it didn't seem to be serving an especially useful purpose over time. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>And the issue remained what to do about his weapons of mass destruction regime.</SPAN> So it was a subject that was on our mind throughout the first part of 2001, even before 9/11 came along. In fact, each one of those tracks, what to do about it if we ever had to do something militarily was on our agenda. We started to think about that, but no war plans were generating yet. We were thinking about it—what do about the no-fly zone and what do about sanctions. <BR><BR>Sanctions became the Secretary of State's problem and I worked for a year to put in place what subsequently became known as ""smart sanctions,"" only allowing humanitarian foodstuff to get in and making sure that weapons were kept out. <BR><BR>Then along comes 9/11, and immediately the issue arose: How do we respond to the Taliban and Al Qaeda, who was being hosted by the Taliban in Afghanistan? And the issue arose immediately: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Iraq. Since Iraq was a source of weapons of mass destruction, it was a terrorist-sponsoring state. And there was some concern that there might be a connection between what happened at 9/11 and Iraq because of its terrorist activity and its sponsorship of those kinds of activities.</SPAN> <BR><BR>And so in our very first series of meetings after 9/11, the famous meeting that took place up at Camp David on the Saturday after 9/11, we focused on this. Should we go after Al Qaeda immediately, and the Taliban, and put down an ultimatum to them? And at the same time, should we deal with an Iraq, or at least start to think about dealing with an Iraq, and what should our priorities be—or one or the other, how to handle it. <BR><BR>And the president decided—and this is also well known—to deal with Afghanistan and deal with Al Qaeda. They're the ones who attacked New York and Washington and Pennsylvania. And so that became the president's policy. We will deal with the Taliban and Al Qaeda. But at the same time, he said this will be a comprehensive campaign against terrorists, against those who harbor terrorists or provide the wherewithal to terrorists to do their dirty deed. <BR><BR>So that early on, even though we're focusing on Afghanistan, we were also going to start turning our attention to Iraq.</P>  <P>[text omitted]</P>  <P>Question: Well, there was a certain period of several months during which it seemed there was a debate going on in here in Washington about how to take the policy forwards. What advice were you giving the president, particularly so during August, during the late summer, about what the objectives should be and how it should be achieved? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: Well, first of all, let me start by saying there is always a debate going on in Washington, and the president in this administration has done quite a bit to inspire such debate by hiring people in his senior national security positions who have strong views about things. None of us, I would say, can be characterized as a shrinking violet. We also have known each other for years and have interacted in different capacities, so we're good friends and we know how to have a good disagreement about something and we know how to serve our president. <BR><BR>And so the debate that we had that summer was, okay, we're not getting anywhere with Iraq, they are simply not complying with these resolutions. And in this post-9/11 period where we can see the nexus between weapons of mass destruction and terrorists, the two coming together, it is not a risk we can continue to run. And the president said this is not a risk I wish to continue to run. And Prime Minister Blair felt pretty much the same way. We had been talking to the British and other nations along the way. <BR><BR>Well, okay, then, how shall we go about this? Shall we just go and decide on our own to undertake a military operation and invade, issue and ultimatum and go? Or should we take this problem back to where the problem belongs, and that is, to the United Nations? The United Nations passed these resolutions, Security Council resolutions, that are now being violated at will, with no consequences. And the president, realizing that this was a major issue for the world, and in the spirit—if I might do this with a slight smile—of multilateralism, elected to take the issue to the United Nations. Nobody disagreed with that decision. Not I, certainly, who helped structure the position. Neither the Vice President nor Secretary Cheney [sic] nor Dr. Rice, for that matter.</P>  <P>[text omitted]</P>  <P>Question: There was skepticism, the reason there was that very long period of debate in the United Nations, particularly from the Russians, but even more perhaps, the French, about America's real intentions, whether they were simply seeking the diplomatic cloak for a war they had already decided on. What's your reaction to that? What is your response to that? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>We had concluded that if the United Nations was not prepared to act in a forceful way that forced Iraq to comply and deliver these weapons of mass destruction, and all the programs associated with them, and 'fess up to the past 15 years, 12 years, of misbehavior,</SPAN> we would go forward with the support of the United Nations' military approval, another—you know, another statement by the United Nations, or without it. And if they did not comply and the Council chose not to take note of it, then we would act with a willing coalition.</P>  <P>[text omitted]</P>  <P>Question: And are you still convinced you will find weapons of mass destruction during this process? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Yes, yes. They're there and we will have to wait and be patient,</SPAN> let the troops finish the work they're doing now, securing and stabilizing the country. And as more and more people come forward who are now free to speak, I think the evidence will be more forthcoming.

960,2003-05-04,"Secretary of State Colin Powell, Interview on NBC's <EM>Meet the Press</EM>","<P>Mr. Russert: But if you look at Iran, the weapons of mass destruction, nuclear development program, harboring terrorists, Al Qaeda presence, how does it differ from Iraq, and why wouldn't we try to liberate the people of Iran the way we liberated the people of Iraq? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: We went into Iraq in response to 12 years of violation of specific U.N. resolutions dealing with weapons of mass destruction, and we went in with the full authority of the United Nations. Whether people agree with that assessment or not, 1441 made it clear that we had a basis to do this. Military force is not necessarily the first option in every one of these situations. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>I believe that Iraq was a more real and present danger in terms of its weapons of mass destruction, which will be uncovered in due course, and because they had demonstrated that they are prepared to invade their neighbors and they have demonstrated they are prepared to use these kinds of weapons outside their own borders and on their own citizens. So I think this was a different case, a clear case, and we acted on that case, as we did in Afghanistan.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Mr. Russert: North Korea. This is what the <EM>Patterns of Global Terrorism</EM> [report] has to say about North Korea: "" . . . continued to sell ballistic missile technology to countries designated by the United States as state sponsors of terrorism, including Syria and Libya."" We now believe that North Korea has one or two nuclear bombs, could be producing five or six more by mid-summer. Will we allow that? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: We, I think, have had some success in recent months in convincing all of North Korea's neighbors that the problem presented to the region and to the world by North Korea is not just a problem between North Korea and the United States, but with all of the nations in the region. And as a result, we got China to take a more active role in sponsoring a multilateral meeting that included China, the United States, and North Korea. South Korea and Japan were not in the meeting, but their interests were certainly represented in that meeting by the United States.</P>  <P>And everybody has now made it clear to North Korea that they will not find any assistance coming to them from the region in terms of economic development, in terms of helping them with their serious economic problems and problems of poverty, unless they abandon their nuclear weapons programs.</P>  <P>They say they have a couple of nuclear weapons. They've admitted that. They are always ambiguous in their statements, masters of ambiguity. They say they have completely reprocessed all of the cells that would—the rods that would give rise to a sufficient amount of plutonium to develop five or six weapons. We can't confirm that with our intelligence, but that's what they say.</P>  <P>And what they have gotten in response to these statements is nothing from us except condemnation. All of their neighbors have now said to them this is not going to get you anywhere, we will not be blackmailed, we will not be intimidated; you do not want to go in this direction because all it will do is further isolate you. And it takes time for the North Koreans to hear these kinds of messages. They are masters of saying all we have to do is keep threatening people, hold our breath, throw tantrums, and they'll come our way. Not going to happen this time. We are not going to be frightened into doing something. We're not going to be intimidated into doing something or blackmailed into doing something that we do not believe will solve this problem once and for all. The agreed framework of 1994 dealt with one aspect of their nuclear weapons capability, but while it dealt with that, temporarily it left the capacity in place for that program to come back. And at the same time we thought we had dealt with that, they started working on another program to develop nuclear weapons. We're not going to fall for that game again. <BR><BR>Mr. Russert: If we wake up six, seven months from now and they have more nuclear weapons, then what happens? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: They have a bigger problem than they have now. Their nuclear weapons are not going to purchase them any political standing that will cause us to be frightened or to think that somehow we now have to march to their tune, march to their drummer. <BR><BR>Mr. Russert: We would never let them sell or transfer those weapons. <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: Absolutely not. <BR><BR>Mr. Russert: Talking about Iraq, you said in due time you believe we will find weapons of mass destruction. Let me go back to your presentation in February at the United Nations and talk about it: ""The gravity of this moment is matched by the gravity of the threat that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction pose to the world. Let me now turn to those deadly weapons programs and describe why they are real and present dangers to the region and to the world. Let me turn now to nuclear weapons. We have no indication that Saddam Hussein has ever abandoned his nuclear weapons program."" <BR><BR>And Vice President Cheney said Saddam Hussein had reconstituted his nuclear program. So we have the Vice President and the Secretary of State. Is there any evidence of a reconstituted nuclear program in Iraq that we have found thus far? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: We haven't found any evidence of nuclear weapons in Iraq as a result of what we have been able to see so far. But a program is more than just a weapon. We didn't think he had a weapon at the time I made that statement or the time the Vice President made his statements or any of the other of my colleagues who made statements. <BR><BR>But what he did keep intact were the scientific wherewithal. And by that, I mean he not only had people with the know-how, but he kept them together so that the know-how could be exploited at a time that he chose. He kept in place the infrastructure. And so he never lost the infrastructure or the brainpower assembled in a way to use that infrastructure if he was ever given a chance to do so because the international community had turned its attention in another direction. <BR><BR>And so it is still our judgment, and it is still my judgment, that if he was given the opportunity and if the international community said fine, you're okay, we're not going to bother you anymore, he would still have pursued that objective. He never lost, in my judgment, and the judgment of the intelligence community, the intent to develop a nuclear weapon, and he kept in place the scientific brainpower and the infrastructure that would have allowed that to happen in due course. <BR><BR>Mr. Russert: How important is it to the credibility of the United States and your own personal credibility that we find weapons of mass destruction? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Oh, I think we will find weapons of mass destruction. I'm the one who presented the case, and proud to have done so.</SPAN> And let me tell you, Tim, we spent a lot of time on that presentation. It was about five straight days and nights of work with the most senior experts of the intelligence community. And with a smile on my face, I would like to point out that over my right shoulder was the director of central intelligence in that picture, George Tenet. We all stood behind that presentation. <BR><BR>And keep in mind that the whole Security Council acknowledged that Saddam Hussein had these weapons of mass destruction when they voted 15-0 for the basic resolution, 1441. It begins with a statement that Saddam Hussein is in material breach of his obligations to account for all of the anthrax and botulinum toxin and all the other things that previous inspectors said he either has and hasn't accounted for, or he won't tell us what happened to this material if he no longer has it. And that was the basis upon which 1441 rested. <BR><BR>And it may well be that as we continue our work with the many teams that are now about the countryside we will find that some of the gaps that were there that he wouldn't account for, we can now account for; even if we don't find weapons, we can find out what happened to that material, I am confident. <BR><BR>Mr. Russert: But it is important. <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Sure, it's important.

In terms of the fight against those who attacked our country on September 11th, the Al Qaeda, harbored by the Taliban, there is no question this has been a successful mission. The abilities of Al Qaeda have been severely diminished, and the president is grateful for that happening.</P>  <P>Obviously, Osama bin Laden has not been captured.

To the extent it was a debate about tactics and timing, the president clearly came down on the side of Afghanistan first.

Now, Russia has a different point of view. You have threatened the world, the United States, for a year and a half that there are [weapons] of mass destruction in Iraq, and so far nobody has found them. So, if the war was carried out because of weapons of mass destruction, so maybe let's let the inspectors go back and make us all sure in the world that there aren't—or there are, but the fact that they're not found yet, the weapons of mass destruction, isn't it troublesome? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: Well, we have started to identify some vehicles that are very suspicious in nature and look quite similar to some of the vehicles that I presented in my speech to the United Nations on the 5th of February. So we'll continue to examine those vehicles to see whether they are mobile biological laboratories. We are going through a great deal of documentation that our troops have picked up, and we have thousands of experts and soldiers who will be examining the entire country and look at suspected sights. Whether or not there is a role for UNMOVIC [United Nations Monitoring, Verification, and Inspection Commission] to play in the absence of the Saddam Hussein regime is an entirely different situation. This is something they'll have to examine. I'm aware that some of our Security Council partners, including the Russian Federation, believe that there is a role for UNMOVIC. We believe that that may not be the case any longer. But it's an area that we'll have to debate.

That's not a domino theory meaning the United States is going to go somewhere else and do the same thing. Not at all.

First, the administration that we are responsible for, the coalition, and then, setting up an interim Iraqi administration and slowly give them authority as they demonstrate capability and ultimately grow that into a government that will be a government of the people of Iraq, as determined by the people of Iraq, and not imposed upon them. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>A government that we are confident will live in peace with its neighbors, not develop weapons of mass destruction, and not use the wealth of the people of Iraq, in the form of its oil, to do things which threaten regional stability.</SPAN>   <P>[text omitted]   <P>Question: Mr. Secretary (inaudible), may I ask what are the latest news about weapons of mass destruction and Saddam Hussein?   <P>Secretary Powell: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>The mobile vans that you may have been reading about, it is becoming clear that these vans can have no other purpose than the production of biological weapons.

President Bush has made it clear that we don't want to stay there a day longer than we have to.

And it seems to me that everybody should be interested in doing it right, not doing it fast, and I think the United Nations, when they passed this resolution, recognized that it will take time. We noticed the resolution asks for a review of the situation in a year, within a year. So certainly, the United Nations in this Security Council resolution recognizes that it is going to take some time.

France, along with all the other nations that voted for 1441, acknowledged that Iraq was in material breach of its obligations to come forward with all the information that it had concerning weapons of mass destruction. France along with the others believed that there was still a program there. Now, if France and the United States differ as how to find out about that program, we believe that the inspectors were being deceived and would never get to the answer. So, we believed that after a reasonable period of time with inspectors, without the kind of cooperation that was required by 1441, it was appropriate to use military force. So far, we have found the biological weapons vans that I spoke about when I presented the case to the United Nations on the 5th of February, and there is no doubt in our minds now that those vans where designed for only one purpose, and that was to make biological weapons.

But, you know, that was something that happened several months ago. Now, we are working with France on a new Security Council resolution, helping the people of Iraq. But was there disappointment? Yes. Did we have a major disagreement? Yes. But because we are friends and we have been allies for all these years, a major disagreement isn't going to break the alliance, or the friendship. Will it put pressure on us? Yes. Should we try to work our way through this and see if there are still some rough edges that have to be dealt with? Yes. Let's not pretend there was no disagreement. There was. But you know, you can have disagreements within families just as you can have between enemies.

Earlier in the month, the Pentagon had announced the discovery of a tractor trailer outfitted with industrial equipment and maintained it was one of the mobile biological weapons labs that had been graphically described by [Secretary of State Colin] Powell in his U.N. presentation. Judy Miller, just before leaving Iraq, had hailed this news in an article that quoted an unidentified Pentagon WMD expert saying that the trailer was ""a smoking gun."" But for weeks there had been no confirmation. Now the CIA had it figured out. The agency's public affairs office arranged a rare conference call for Washington reporters so officials could brief them about this important finding.

Many intelligence professionals found it full of holes, a shoddy piece of work that had been prepared more for public relations purposes than legitimate analysis. The document itself conceded that not a trace of biological agents had been found in the trailers. Why not? How was that possible? The CIA claimed the absence suggested the Iraqis had ""thoroughly decontaminated"" the trailers—a claim some weapons experts thought implausible because it would have been virtually impossible to scrub trace residues from the trailers. There was also another problem spotted by government weapons analysts: the tanks in the supposed trailer labs didn't have a drain. That was, one senior DIA [Defense Intelligence Agency] analyst later noted, a ""killer"" issue. ""You can't foment biological weapons agents in a tank without a drain.

It begins, ""In the months leading up to the war with Iraq, both the United States and British governments claimed that they had compelling evidence that Saddam Hussein was stockpiling weapons of mass destruction. Because of national security, the exact nature of the information could not be revealed. We are now some seven weeks into the occupation of Iraq, and I have to ask where are the stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction? Was this war waged under a false pretext, or are there intelligence-gathering failures? An affirmative answer to either would be unsettling."" <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: Well, I can assure you that this war was not waged under any false pretext. The material that Secretary [of State Colin] Powell presented to the world and the United Nations, and the material that Prime Minister [Tony]&nbsp;Blair and his government in England presented to the world was intelligence information that had been gathered, accumulated, and was appropriate for declassification. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>We believed then, and we believe now, that the Iraqis have—had chemical weapons, biological weapons, and that they had a program to develop nuclear weapons, but did not have nuclear weapons.</SPAN> That is what the United Kingdom's intelligence suggested as well. We still believe that. We also know that he has used chemical weapons—Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons against his own people, against the Kurds, and against the Iranians. So it—you have the combination of intelligence, good intelligence, plus a pattern of having already used those weapons. <BR><BR>Now, why haven't we been able to provide the kind of evidence that would have validated all of that in the last seven weeks—less than seven weeks, still, since Baghdad fell. And I think the answers are several reasons. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>And number one, it's not because they're not there. We believe they're there.</SPAN> But it is a country about the size of California. There are literally hundreds of suspect sites. Saddam Hussein had been functioning in an inspections environment for years and years, and has gotten very good at it. <BR><BR>They were able to hide things very successfully. They took documentation. They threatened people and killed people who said that they might talk. You may recall that two of his sons-in-law left the country and went to, I believe, Jordan and revealed their WMD programs. And when they came back to Iraq, they were murdered by Saddam Hussein—his two sons-in-law. So the people were intimidated and threatened. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>We never believed that we or inspectors would just suddenly trip over them and find them.

1001,2003-05-30,"Secretary of State Colin Powell, Remarks en Route to Poland","<P>Question: I just wanted to ask, going into the G8 if you are at all disappointed by the seeming lukewarm support of some of these countries to help out in the reconstruction of Iraq? And has the sort of slow progress, perhaps, of finding weapons of mass destruction sort of impeded that effort to get them on board? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: Let me go to the first part of your question, on lukewarm. I don't know that I would call it lukewarm. I mean, we're having an initial donors conference on the 24th of June in New York, preliminary donors conference, and then a major donors conference a month or so later where we expect significant contributions to be made. <BR><BR>The Pentagon is going through all of the offers that have come forward to put military forces and police forces and other kind of forces in to help with security and stability. A number of countries that I visited recently—France, Germany, Russia—are all interested in doing more with respect to reconstruction. And they're anxious, of course, to see if contracts are out there for them. You know, nothing wrong with that, because there is going to be money available now that is oil is flowing, so that Iraq can start rebuilding itself. <BR><BR>So I wouldn't characterize it lukewarm, I think we're getting quite a solid response from the international community. I think it's telling that when we passed resolution 1483, the lifting sanctions resolution, it only took us a—less than 10 days to do that, and we got a unanimous vote, if I can count Syria, that kind of came in after the vote and said, yes, we vote yes, too. I think that was a pretty good expression of support to lift the sanctions and get on with the rebuilding. <BR><BR>On the second part of your question on weapons of mass destruction, more teams are going over. We will exploit all of the information we have. More interviews will be conducted with people who are now available. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Documents are being looked at in greater detail. The biological weapons facilities, the mobile ones that the DIA [Defense Intelligence Agency] and CIA put a paper out on the other day, I think make it clear that there is such a capability that's existed over the years. <BR><BR>And the international community always felt that Saddam Hussein was guilty of having these weapons, which was the basis upon which they passed&nbsp; [U.N. Resolution]1441 in the first place. And I'm quite confident that the evidence will be forthcoming, so there can be no doubt in anyone's mind.</SPAN>  <P>[text omitted]  <P>Question: Getting back to weapons of mass destruction for a minute. You were obviously on the ground in the region as a military commander. You know as much about Hussein and his capabilities as anybody in the government, probably. Are you surprised that 72 days into this operation there have not yet been any of the large catches [sic] of weapons found that were predicted before hand? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: Well, we found the vans. And we found a lot of documents. And the initial read from the documents suggests that these programs were there. Now, reflect again on what the charges were in 1441 and what the international community has been saying for years. There were gaps in knowledge. And the Iraqis would not step forward and bridge those gaps. </P>  <P>We had clear evidence that so many liters of a particular item had been produced, botchulinen [sic], or anthrax, so many rounds of chemical artillery had been produced. And they refused to explain the gaps between what we know is produced and what inspectors could identify. And so that, in itself, was the violation, or one of the violations that formed the basis of resolution 1441. We knew they were doing things—not just gaps in knowledge, we knew they were doing things. </P>  <P>The presentation I made on the 5th of February, where I put up the cartoons of those biological vans, we didn't just make up them up one night. Those were eyewitness accounts of people who had worked in the program and knew it was going on, multiple accounts. And when I put them up, showed the four cartoons, people kind of, well, who knows. Guess what? You should have seen the smile on my face when one day the intelligence community came in and gave me a photo, and said, look. And it was almost identical to the cartoon that I had put up in New York on the 5th of February. <BR><BR>We have examined those vans repeatedly for the last several weeks, and we are confident that's what they are. Now, there will be other theories that come from time to time—oh, it was a hydrogen making thing for balloons. No. You now have a white paper from the intelligence community reflecting the views of the Director of Central Intelligence and the Director of DIA that that's what it's for, with appropriate balancing caveats in there, to say, we haven't found any contamination within it because they either haven't been used or they've been cleaned. But there's no question in the mind of the intelligence community as to what it was designed for. <BR><BR>And so that is a clear case of solid evidence. And then gaps in intelligence which we're trying to fill as a result of the exploitations taking place. <BR><BR>Question: You have no concerns that have risen the last couple weeks that any of this intelligence was politicized, as some people are charging, and that you are totally confident in the intelligence? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: I have been through many crises in my career in government. And there are always people who come after the fact, to say, this wasn't what was presented to you, or this was politicized or this wasn't. Let people look into it, let people examine it. <BR><BR>I know that [CIA] Director [George]&nbsp;Tenet is looking at everything that he has been doing in the recent past. You've been reading reports about that. I'm sure Congress will be looking into this. I'm sure the president's oversight and others, PFIAB [President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board] and others, will be examining all of this in due course, as part of their routine work. And you can make your own judgment. <BR><BR>My judgment was based on when the president asked me to present the case to the world. And I went out to the CIA, and I spent four days and four nights going over everything that they had as holdings, and not just me and George Tenet, a room full of analysts, the raw documents, the papers. <BR><BR>And everything I presented on the 5th of February, I can tell you, there was good sourcing for, was not politicized, it was solid information that was being presented to us for our consideration for that briefing, not by political appointees, but by the analysts who were responsible for it. <BR><BR>And I was there until midnight three straight nights, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, with the analysts themselves, challenging them, because I knew that it was the credibility of the United States that was going to be on the line on the 5th of February.

I was just wondering as of today, where you consider the weapons of mass destruction to be and why the United Nations and weapons inspectors are still not being invited back into Iraq. <BR><BR>Wolfowitz: Well on the second point, they're certainly welcome to come back, and in fact I believe we've made some arrangements already for the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] to come back to do some checking on sites that are known. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>But bear in mind this regime had 12 years to develop very sophisticated methods of hiding things.

1007,2003-05-31,"Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, Interview With CNN International","Question: There is a report in <EM>Vanity Fair</EM> today that just quoted you as saying that the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq was just a bureaucratic reason. Can you respond to that? <BR><BR>Wolfowitz: No, it's a misquote. In fact, the full quote you can see on our website where the whole interview is there. What I was trying to explain—there's a complicated situation. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>We had, in fact, three concerns about Iraq, from the beginning, and it's repeated in [Secretary of State] Colin Powell's statement in the U.N. One was weapons of mass destruction, about which I've never seen as unanimous a view in the intelligence community on almost any issue. Second was the Iraqi connection with terrorism, about which there is a range of views, although everyone agrees that there is a connection there. And the third was Iraq's mistreatment of its people, which has unfortunately never been in any doubt. But in many ways, it's the first two reasons that were crucial, and as I said in that interview, there is really a fourth reason, which is that connection between weapons of mass destruction and terrorism. That's the axis the president originally was talking about in his State of Union message, is that connection between terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. It's complicated, it's not a simple issue, but when people say our rationale keeps changing, it's not that keeps changing. We've had all three of those reasons from the beginning, but people who often choose to focus exclusively on the weapons of mass destruction piece of it.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Question: Even this article seems to highlight the distrust that's around that. The perception seems to be that weapons mass destruction was an excuse to move in. How did you respond— <BR><BR>Wolfowitz: I can tell you quite emphatically it was not an excuse. What really changed in our whole perception of this issue was September 11. Before September 11 terrorism was viewed as something ugly, but you lived with it. Saddam Hussein was viewed as something ugly, something that was for the Iraqi people to take care of. After September 11, terrorism looked different. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Saddam Hussein, who played with terrorists, and had weapons of mass destruction, looked much more threatening to United States than just to his own people.</SPAN> And so it changed the calculation entirely. I mean, without that perception of threat, I don't believe the president would have considered it something that American lives should be risked for, as terrible as the regime is—I mean there is no question the regime was a horrible thing. <BR><BR>Question: The fact that there hasn't been substantial cache of weapons of mass destruction—is that an embarrassment? <BR><BR>Wolfowitz: No. Is it an embarrassment to people on the other side that we've discovered these biological production vans, which the defector told us about? Look, this dictator had twelve years to develop innumerable ways to hide his program, and we've said from the beginning, the only way you get to the bottom of it is when people start to talk to you. That's why we gave the U.N. inspectors unprecedented powers to interview people. I think it's evidence in itself that Saddam never allowed a single one of scientists to go outside the country for interview. In fact he never allowed a single one of them to be interviewed in the country without monitors present or at least tape recorders present. So he was a man with something to hide, and we'll have to find it.",True,"Iraq, WMD, chemical, biological, nuclear, Axis of Evil, Al Qaeda, FS","Saddam Hussein, George W.

I cannot tell you how much it has meant to President Bush, to me and to all Americans to have President [correction: Prime Minister] Berlusconi's strong support, and the strong support of the Italian government <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>and people for what needed to be done to bring a dictator to justice, to deal with a regime that had totally ignored all U.N. resolutions for many years, in keeping and developing weapons of mass destruction.</SPAN> That dictator is now gone as a result of the coalition of the willing, and now the challenge before us is to help the Iraqi people, and we know that Italy will play an important and powerful role in that effort.&nbsp;<BR><BR>[text omitted]&nbsp;<BR><BR>Question: (as translated from Italian) The United States government justified the war in Iraq with a need to prevent the use of chemical and biological weapons of destruction, of which so far there is no proof. Did the U.S. government have the wrong information or have they simply not been found yet? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>There were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. It wasn't a figment of anyone's imagination. Iraq used these weapons against Iran in the late '80s. Iraq used such weapons against its own people in the late '80s. When the Gulf War was over in 1991, we found such weapons and destroyed some of them. Inspectors were in Iraq for years and were forced to leave Iraq in 1998 without getting the answers that were needed with respect to what weapons remained, where they were and what programs were still underway. <BR><BR>So there is no question, there is no debate here. Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and they tossed out, caused the inspectors to have to leave, therefore, tossed out the inspectors in 1998. And for the years that followed, until the fall of 2002, Iraq simply ignored the demands of the international community to allow the inspectors back in and resolve this issue. In the fall of 2002, in the U.N. Resolution 1441, every member of the Security Council, all fifteen, unanimously agreed to a resolution that started out with the proposition that Iraq was in material breach of its obligations, that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. There is no doubt in my mind as I went through the intelligence, and as I prepared myself for the briefing that I gave to the Security Council on the 5th of February, that the evidence was overwhelming, that they had continued to develop these programs.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Iraq convicted itself when Iraq would not provide answers demanded by the international community. Iraq further placed itself in material breach when it did not cooperate fully with the inspectors in a way that the inspectors could do their job. And under the terms of 1441, it was perfectly appropriate, it was the right thing to do, for a coalition of the willing, even if the entire U.N. Security Council did not wish to join in the effort, but for a coalition of the willing to take the bold political step to decide that this regime had to be changed because it refused to comply with the will of the international community. <BR><BR>We are sending in the most extensive regime, we are putting in place the most extensive regime imaginable, to look at all of the sites, to exploit all of the documents that have come into our possession since the war, and to interview people who are now available, who were not made for interview by the Iraqis previously. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>We have already discovered mobile biological factories of the kind that I described to the Security Council on the 5th of February. We have now found them. There is no question in our mind that that's what their purpose was. Nobody has come up with an alternate purpose that makes sense.</SPAN> <BR><BR>And so I think the case is clear, the case is made, the case has been made by the international coalition, it was previously made by the inspectors, and Iraq has previously admitted to having these weapons of mass destruction and refused to tell the international community their current status, thus leading to Resolution 1441 and subsequently leading to Operation Iraqi Freedom. <BR><BR>And now, the Iraqi people are free, they're liberated, they're no longer living under a regime that would lie to the international community or deny its activities to the international community. And what we have to do now is not get trapped in the longwinded debates about what was known and not known, and these kinds of recriminations, but move on and help the Iraqi people build a stable society, a democratic nation where all the people are represented in government. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>And what we don't have to worry about is any future regime in Iraq, any future government in Iraq developing weapons of mass destruction or terrorizing its own people or supporting terrorism against other people in the region.</SPAN>",True,"Iraq, WMD, chemical, biological, nuclear, FS","Saddam Hussein, George W.

Back to Iraq, you didn't find the smoking gun, did you? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Well, there are smoking guns all over. Remember, Iraq has weapons of mass destruction. We found them in 1991. The inspectors found them when they went in. We destroyed some of their weapons of mass destruction in 1991. They have weapons of mass destruction, they've had them, they used them against Iran. That is not disputable. They used weapons of mass destruction against their own people. We know that they threw the inspectors out in 1998 rather than let the inspectors find more weapons of mass destruction.</SPAN></P>  <P>And so, when the United Nations met last year and passed Resolution 1441, it was because every member of the Security Council that voted that day believed that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, and something had to be done about it. We gave Iraq an opportunity to say to the world, no we don't. Here are all of our papers, here is all the documentation, we're opening up everything, come and see that we have nothing. They didn't do that. They hid. They gave a false declaration, they continued to try to keep the inspectors from getting everywhere that the inspectors needed to go. And we made a case, I made the case to the United Nations just in February as to what we knew, and I showed drawings of a biological laboratory. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>We found that biological laboratory, now everybody can see it. We're confident as we continue our work with exploitation, as we send in more experts, as we interview more Iraqis, as we translate more of the documents, we will find more evidence of what they have been doing over all these years. </P>  <P>So, this suggestion that there were never any weapons—yes there were. The inspectors found them, we found them, we've seen them. We blew up some, but we always believed that Iraq continued to have these weapons and continued to develop these weapons. And there can be no suggestion that Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction. They did and the whole world knew it. And when finally Iraq refused—refused—to account for their weapons, to tell us what happened to anthrax and to botulinum, to tell us what they were doing to come clean and avoid a war—then we had to use military force and go ahead and remove this regime because this regime did not comply with the will of the international community.</SPAN></P>",True,"Iraq, WMD, chemical, biological, FS","Saddam Hussein, George W.

You talked the other day about the preparations you made for your presentation. Can you give a bit more detail about how much material you rejected as your presentation? What proportion of the material presented to you by the intelligence people and how you went over this as well with the British? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: The president asked me to make the presentation. Some work had been done on what a presentation would look like. We assembled all the work that had been done—[CIA] Director [George] Tenet has testified before the Congress, so there was a great deal of material around—and what I had to do was cull the material and get it down to a manageable amount that one can give in one presentation. There was even some suggestion that it ought to be spread out over three days, or a very, very long session on one day. But after thinking about it and reflecting on it, it seemed to me that if we're going to bring everybody together, it had to be done in the one day and at one session, with some practical limits on the amount of time you can devote to such a session. <BR><BR>As a result of that, I started to work through the material with my staff. We also know that it was an important presentation, and it had to be something that was supportable. And so as we walked through it over a period of about oh, five days, I guess, we kept trimming to make sure that everything I was to present on behalf of the United States Government was supportable by the intelligence community. <BR><BR>This wasn't material I was making up, it came from the intelligence community and I wanted to make sure that the intelligence community was comfortable with everything I was going to say and would support everything I was going to say. And that's why, when we had these sessions, it was with the analysts themselves, with office directors, individual analysts. <BR><BR>Director Tenet sat there with me throughout this entire period, as did John McLaughlin. I think they were there for the whole time. <BR><BR>The case we put forward on the 5th of February reflected an effort on our part to distill down the huge volume of material on weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, and human rights violations, down to something that was manageable and that I could present in a period of about an hour and 30 minutes, which is I think [turned out about an hour and] 20, something like that. <BR><BR>There was a lot of additional information that was very solid and substantiated that I didn't use because I didn't have time to use it all, and anything that we weren't totally comfortable with, we didn't use.

You don't have nine sources, but it's true as the fact that the sun will come up tomorrow morning in the east, but you just can't prove it in the time that you get it, and that's where judgment comes into play and you have to use your instincts to tell you whether or not something should be used or not. <BR><BR>But in this case, because of the attention that was being focused on the briefing, and the importance of the briefing, I wanted to make sure that it was solid information, multiple-sourced, and reflected the considered and unanimous view of the intelligence community analysts who are responsible for it. <BR><BR>I was not only presenting on behalf of the United States of America and on my own behalf, I was presenting the work of the intelligence community and they wanted to make sure that it was solid as well.",False,"Iraq, WMD, chemical, biological","Saddam Hussein, George W.

Everybody knows that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. Iraq has used weapons of mass destruction in the past. The inspectors found weapons of mass destruction. The United States Armed Forces during Gulf War One found weapons of mass destruction and destroyed weapons of mass destruction. Iraq failed to account for what they had.

Mr. Secretary, eleven weeks have passed since the coalition forces moved into Iraq. Yet you've found no weapons of mass destruction in that country—no convincing evidence yet. Given that, are you still convinced that you'll be able to find such weapons eventually and, in the absence of such weapons, how can you still justify the war, and what would you say to those critics in Japan and the rest of the world who've been saying that the war was mainly about oil? <BR><BR>Wolfowitz: Well, let me start with the last part. The notion that the war was ever about oil is a complete piece of nonsense. If the United States had been interested in Iraq's oil, it would have been very simple 12 years ago or any time in the last 12 years to simply do a deal with Saddam Hussein. We probably could have had any kind of preferred customer status we wanted if we'd been simply willing to drop our real concerns. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Our real concerns focused on the threat posed by that country—not only its weapons of mass destruction, but also its support for terrorism and, most importantly, the link between those two things.</SPAN> You said it's eleven weeks since our troops first crossed the Kuwaiti border, and coalition troops first entered Iraq, as though eleven weeks were a long time. Eleven weeks is a very short time. In fact, unfortunately, significant elements of the old regime are still out there shooting at Americans, killing Americans, threatening Iraqis. It is not yet a secure situation and I believe that probably influences to some extent the willingness of Iraqis to speak freely to us. <BR><BR>We—as the whole world knows—have in fact found some significant evidence to confirm exactly what Secretary [of State Colin] Powell said when he spoke to the United Nations about the development of mobile biological weapons production facilities that would seem to confirm fairly precisely the information we received from several defectors, one in particular who described the program in some detail. But I wouldn't suggest we've gotten to the bottom of the whole story yet. We said, when [U.N.] Resolution 1441 was being adopted, that the most important thing was to have free and unintimidated access to Iraqis who know where these things are. Simply going and searching door to door in a country the size of the state of California is not the way you would find things. You would find things when people start to give you information—we're still in an early stage of that process and there is no question we will get to the bottom of what's there. <BR><BR>But there should be no doubt whatsoever this was a war undertaken because our president and the Prime Minister of England and the other countries that joined with us believe—and I think they believe correctly—that this regime was a threat to our security and a threat that we could no longer live with.

1019,2003-06-08,"National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, Interview on ABC's <EM>This Week</EM>","<P>Rice: . . . to use weapons of mass destruction, and of course, is, is at odds with the National Intelligence Estimate in October of 2002 to which the DIA [Defense Intelligence Agency] signed on. Saying, for instance, that the Iraqis likely had as much as a 100 to 500 metric tons of chemical, uh, agent. So, uh, this is selective quotation. This is, um, a kind of revisionist history. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>There was, uh, no doubt in people's minds that the Iraqi regime had, uh, weapons of mass destruction programs, that, uh, there were large missing stockpiles. People talked in this town a lot about connecting the dots after September 11th. If you connected the dots about everything that we knew about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction programs going back to 1991 and going all the way up until March, 2003, when we launched the attack against Iraq you could come to only one conclusion. And that was that this was an active program, that this was a dangerous program. This was a program that was being effectively concealed. There was a lot of deception to deceive, uh, the international community and weapons inspectors. But, uh, this was a dangerous program and, uh, whether you talk to outside proliferation experts or whether you talk to successive directors of Central Intelligence, or the current director of Central Intelligence, that was the overwhelming assessment of the intelligence community.</SPAN> </P>  <P>George Stephanopoulos: You said it was selective quotation. Just to be clear, that was all that's been released in the public realm from the Defense Intelligence Agency. </P>  <P>Rice: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>We're, we're looking, we're looking at this, but Admiral [Lowell] Jacoby, when he talked about this the other day, made very clear that his agency had signed on to an intelligence estimate that said that there were weapons of mass destruction indeed had talked specifically about chemical agents that could be weaponized. We also, by the way, were looking at reports for preparation for the use of chemical weapons. We were also looking at, are looking at the fact that chemical suits have been found and atropine injectors, which are antidotes to chemical weapons use. There's a very large body of evidence here that connects together to paint a picture of a very dangerous regime with very dangerous weapons that had deceived the world for 12 years, that had allowed international sanctions to stay on, rather than come clean about what it was doing. Either you believe Saddam Hussein or you believe the overwhelming bulk of evidence.</SPAN> </P>  <P>George Stephanopoulos: But let me, let me raise another area where the evidence was problematic. And this was the issue of whether or not Iraq was trying to get uranium from Africa. Here's what the president said in the State of the Union address: </P>  <P>President Bush (replay of tape): The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa. </P>  <P>George Stephanopoulos: That claim was later discredited by the International Atomic Energy Agency, found that to be based on forged documents. So how did it make it into the State of the Union address? </P>  <P>Rice: At the time that the State of the Union address was prepared, there were also other sources that said that they were, the Iraqis were seeking yellowcake, uranium oxide from Africa. And that was taken out of a British report. Clearly, that particular report, we learned subsequently, subsequently, was not credible. But it was also a very small part, George, of a larger picture of a program aimed at developing nuclear weapons. </P>  <P>George Stephanopoulos: Let me stop you right there, because many in the United States government knew before then that this, this . . . </P>  <P>Rice: George, somebody, somebody down may have known. But I will tell you that when this issue was raised, uh, with the intelligence community, because, uh, we actually do go through the process of asking, uh, the intelligence community, can you say this? Can you say that? Can you say this? The intelligence community did not know at that time or at levels that got to us that this, that there was serious questions about this report. </P>  <P>George Stephanopoulos: But let me show you something. This is, this is a column from Nicholas Kristof in <EM>The New York Times,</EM> it was on May 6th. And he wrote in that column, ""More than a year ago, the vice president's office asked for an investigation of the uranium deal so a former U.S. ambassador to Africa was dispatched to Niger. In February, 2002, according to someone present at the meetings, that envoy reported to the CIA and the State Department that the information was unequivocally wrong and that the documents had been forged. The envoy's debunking of the forgery was passed around the administration and seemed to be accepted except that President Bush and the State Department kept citing it anyway."" That's hardly low level, the vice president's office. </P>  <P>Rice: Well, the vice president's office may have asked for that report, but I'm telling you, George, that the information that this particular report, this particular report, which was cited by the British, and if you notice, the president cites the British on this. This particular report was not known to us as a forgery. </P>  <P>George Stephanopoulos: But why would he say the British if there were people in the U.S. government and I know the State Department Bureau of Intelligence researched it, I spoke to someone there yesterday, knew it wasn't true and discredited it. </P>  <P>Rice: George, I am telling you that when this was raised with the intelligence community, they said what we could say. And there were other attempts to, to get yellowcake from Africa. But the important thing here is that this case about the nuclear weapons program did not rest on a document that the British cited. This case rested on Saddam Hussein's, um, infrastructure for the development of nuclear weapons. It rested on procurement activities to, uh, to try and acquire pieces that, of, uh, centrifuges that might be used. </P>  <P>George Stephanopoulos: The aluminum tubes? </P>  <P>Rice: Well, and, and, um, magnets and balancing equipment and all kinds of things. It also rested on the expertise that he kept together. The fact is that there is now a lot of revisionism that says there was disagreement on this data point or disagreement on that data point. But the overwhelming assessment of the intelligence community, the, the director of Central Intelligence has a disciplined process which he runs. It's called a National Intelligence Estimate. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>And the overwhelming bulk of the evidence in there, not about a data point there or a data point there, but about what Saddam Hussein was doing, was that he had weapons of mass destruction. That was the judgment. That he was continuing to improve his weapons of masses [sic]&nbsp;destruction capabilities. That he was hiding these from the world, that there were large unaccounted for stockpiles. That was not just U.S. intelligence, that was the U.N. inspectors.</SPAN> And we already knew that this is somebody who had used them in the past. And as President Clinton said when he directed an attack on Iraq in December of 1998, there was every reason to believe he would use them again. So we have a long history here leading up to the decision to use force in 2003, and it is a picture in which the intelligence community connected a lot of dots from multiple services, from multiple sources to come up with, uh, the picture on which the president acted. </P>  <P>George Stephanopoulos: As you know, we're now seeing a lot of intelligence officials, some on the record, some off the record, some current, some former, raising a lot of questions about the intelligence estimates. And I want to play something that the president said when he was setting up the Homeland Security Department a year ago. At the same time, he was trying to encourage front line agents who had information about threats to come forward. And this what is he had to say: </P>  <P>President Bush (replay of tape): If you're a front line worker for the FBI, the CIA, some other law enforcement or intelligence agency, and you see something that raises suspicions, I want you to report it immediately. </P>  <P>George Stephanopoulos: Would you like the intelligence agencies, agents at any level now, if they have information about Iraqi intelligence to come forward in the same manner? </P>  <P>Rice: It would be a very good thing if anyone has information, of course. People want to hear it. But I can't respond to unnamed officials who, who now try and rewrite the history of how this intelligence came to the president. The president gets his intelligence from his director of Central Intelligence [DCI], who runs a disciplined process. It takes into account the views of the different intelligence agencies. It takes into account differences about this data point or that data point. But when you look at the picture and you ask yourself, did people believe that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction? Yes. Everybody believed that. DCI's believed it in the past, the current DCI believed it. The foreign intelligence services believed it. The U.S. intelligence service believed it. You have to believe somehow that Saddam Hussein was willing, for 12 years, defying the international community, staying under sanctions, never answering questions satisfactorily, that he just did that kind of for the heck of it.</P>",True,"Iraq, WMD, chemical, biological, nuclear, uranium, FS","Saddam Hussein, George W.

This was the article from the <EM>Atlanta Constitution,</EM> which read as follows: ""Six weeks after the war ended, Iraq remains a torn and divided country. Crime still threatens. Hospitals run at quarter-speed. Water, sewer, and electric systems remain broken or inconsistent."" </P>  <P>What a mess. If someone said to you, ""Dr. Rice, we have 200,000 troops in Iraq. We haven't found the weapons of mass destruction. Saddam Hussein cannot be located. Chaos reigns. The radical Shiites are refusing to cooperate with the U.S. representative on the ground""—was this a pyrrhic victory? <BR><BR>Dr. Rice: It is certainly not time to make such an assessment. The question is: What was the alternative? <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>The alternative was to have Saddam Hussein in power, oppressing his people, threatening his neighbors, sitting there with weapons of mass destruction programs sitting there 12 years after the Gulf War, continuing to defy the international community.</SPAN> It's going to be difficult to rebuild Iraq—the president has always made that very clear—not because of the war, not because of damage done in the war, but because of the damage psychologically, physically, to the Iraqi people and to their hopes and dreams for the last 30 years. </P>  <P>This has been one of the world's most brutal regimes. It is not surprising that the Iraqi people just now coming to a political horizon after 30 years of—shall we call it a vertical conversation?—that they now have to have a horizontal conversation in which all Iraqis are represented and in which they try to chart a future. It is not surprising that some pockets of resistance by bad people, the Fedayeen Saddam or Ba'athists, continue.&nbsp;<BR><BR>[text omitted]&nbsp;<BR><BR>Mr. Russert: Since the president declared that the military operations were over on May 1, combat operations, we've lost 42 American soldiers. We're losing more than one soldier a day. How long are we prepared to take that kind of toll? <BR><BR>Dr. Rice: Tim, the president has always said that this will take time. If you think about the many fronts in the war on terrorism in which we have to fight—Iraq, Afghanistan, the law enforcement fronts on which we're fighting—and you go back to the president's September 20 speech to the Congress shortly after the attack on September 11, he talked about a long and different kind of war. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Iraq is one of those fronts in dealing with a regime that dealt with terrorists, that had weapons of mass destruction, that was a supporter of instability in the Middle East.</SPAN> We've just seen the president take on the problems between the Palestinians and the Israelis. Yes, this is going to be hard.&nbsp;<BR><BR>[text omitted]&nbsp;<BR><BR>Mr. Russert: Weapons of mass destruction: The president and people throughout the administration said that Saddam Hussein posed an imminent threat because he possessed weapons of mass destruction. Here's what the president said: </P>  <P>""Intelligence gathered by this and other governments leaves no doubt that the Iraq regime continues to possess and conceal some of the most lethal weapons ever devised."" And the vice president: ""Simply stated, there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction."" </P>  <P>Was there truly an imminent threat and where are the weapons of mass destruction? <BR><BR>Dr. Rice: There are two separable issues here. What did we have in terms of intelligence estimates before going in and what have we found? In terms of intelligence estimates going in, the October 2002 intelligence estimate, National Intelligence Estimate, which is the definitive estimate by the intelligence community, said in its key judgments, <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction, for instance, on chemical weapons, 100 to 500 metric tons of chemical agent in the country; a biological weapons program that was being rapidly reconstituted; evidence of efforts to reconstitute a nuclear program. And it was not just American intelligence.</SPAN> There was supporting intelligence from all over the world. There was, of course, the United Nations weapons inspectors talking about unaccounted for stockpiles of VX and anthrax and sarin gas. </P>  <P>And this didn't start in September of 2002 with the president's speech to the United Nations. This goes back to 1991 where we know that he had weapons of mass destruction, 1994 to 1995 where more came out about his biological weapons program after he finally revealed that when a high-level defector left the country and spooked him into revealing. In 1996, a testimony by then-CIA director John Deutch saying, ""He has weapons of mass destruction."" In 1998, after weapons inspectors left the country, President Clinton addressing the country from the Oval Office and saying, ""He has weapons that I am certain he will use. That's why we're using military force against Saddam Hussein."" There's a bit of revisionist history going on here. The truth of the matter is that repeated directors of Central Intelligence, repeated reports by intelligence agencies around the world, repeated reports by U.N. inspectors asking hard questions of <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Saddam Hussein, and tremendous efforts by this regime to conceal and hide what it was doing clearly give a picture of a regime that had weapons of mass destruction and was determined to conceal them.</SPAN> </P>  <P>Mr. Russert: As you know, others are saying that the intelligence was—Senator Joe Biden used the word ""hyped"" by the administration to provide a rationale for the war. And this is what has been accumulated over the following weeks. This from <EM>U.S. News &amp; World Report:</EM> ""For months, the vice president's office and the Pentagon had been more aggressive than either State or the CIA when it came to making the case against Iraq. Veteran intelligence officers were dismayed. 'The policy decisions weren't matching the reports we were reading every day,' says an intelligence official. In September 2002, <EM>U.S. News</EM> has learned, the Defense Intelligence Agency issued a classified assessment of Iraq's chemical weapons. It concluded: 'There is no reliable information on whether Iraq is producing and stockpiling chemical weapons.'"" </P>  <P>And let me show you some comments of some other people and then give you a chance to respond. ""'The American people were manipulated,' bluntly declares one person from the Defense Intelligence Agency who says he was privy to all the intelligence there on Iraq."" </P>  <P>And then this. ""'The Al Qaeda connection and nuclear weapons issue were the only ways that you could link Iraq to an imminent security threat to the U.S.,' notes Greg Thielmann, who retired in September after 25 years in the State Department, the last four in the Bureau of Intelligence and Research. 'And the administration was grossly distorting the intelligence on both things.'"" </P>  <P>And then this. ""Ray McGovern, a retired CIA analyst who briefed President Bush's father in the White House in the 1980s, said that people in the agency were now 'totally demoralized.' He says, and others back him up, that the Pentagon took dubious accounts from emigres close to Ahmad Chalabi and gave these tales credibility they did not deserve."" </P>  <P>And last night in Iowa, Bob Graham, the former chairman of the Intelligence Committee, now running for president, said, ""Information was essentially politicized, manipulated. Those parts that the president liked became placed in the president's speeches, and those that they didn't like got put in the trash can."" <BR><BR>Dr. Rice: I just don't understand this argument. As I said, revisionist history all over the place. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>This has gone on with Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction for the better part of 12 years. Successive CIA directors, successive administrations have known that we had every reason to judge that he had weapons of mass destruction.</SPAN> </P>  <P>Now, the president gets his intelligence from his intelligence agencies, most especially from his director of Central Intelligence, not from all kinds of splinter groups, and I can't really speak to unnamed people who refuse to come forward but quote on—unattributed to the press. But I can tell you that the director of Central Intelligence, the deputy director of Central Intelligence who briefed the Congress, who briefed the president, who oversaw the national intelligence estimate that said, ""This regime, we judge, has weapons of mass destruction"" is where the president got his intelligence. </P>  <P>Mr. Russert: Where are they? <BR><BR>Dr. Rice: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Well, Tim, the question of where and how we're going to find his weapons of mass destruction is a separable question from what we knew going in. The fact is this was a program that was built for concealment. We've always known that. We've always known that it would take some time to put together a full picture of his weapon, weapons of mass destruction programs. We've always known that interviews with scientists and with those who were involved in the program would be the most credible evidence as to how this program was put together. In fact, the reason that we pressed so hard to have the weapons inspectors take people out of the country and interview them was because we knew that these were the people who could tell us how this program was put together for concealment.</P>  <P>But I want to go back to the question of what we knew going in. You had a director of Central Intelligence who produced an estimate that said this regime had weapons of mass destruction. That was based on multiple sources. It was based on information from multiple security services. It was based on information that the weapons inspectors said was missing about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program. </P>  <P>People talked in this town a lot about connecting the dots. In this case, you had hundreds of dots to connect that showed that this regime which had had weapons of mass destruction, which had used them in the past, which had gone to great lengths to conceal them, which would never tell the truth about them, which was keeping its own people under tough U.N. sanctions to avoid detection of the program—you had a lot of dots. There is only one way to connect them, and that was that this was a regime that was determined to hold on to its weapons of mass destruction and that that was a danger to the United States and to its allies.</SPAN></P>  <P>&nbsp;Mr. Russert: <EM>The Washington Post</EM> reported that Vice President [Dick] Cheney made numerous trips to the CIA and that some people at the CIA felt pressured because of his presence to provide information to the president and vice president that they wanted to see. <BR><BR>Dr. Rice: Simply not true. The vice president did make trips to the CIA, although no one talks about exactly how he's briefed or even how the president is briefed. But I can tell you this: This administration has experienced foreign policy people who are consumers of intelligence and who do ask difficult and tough questions of intelligence officials. But the director of Central Intelligence has said and has assured all of us that he has no evidence or any belief that anybody was pressured at any time to change estimates or to change their assessments. We received the best that the intelligence agencies could produce about this very vast program. The assessments that we received in October of 2002 were wholly consistent with the assessments that had gone back into time including during the Clinton administration, assessments that had led President Clinton to attack Iraq, to go after those programs. So this is a long history and we need not revise it. </P>  <P>Mr. Russert: Let me show you a specific comment the president made in his State of the Union message on January 28, 2003, when he talked about uranium from Africa. Let's watch: (Videotape, January 28): </P>  <P>President Bush: The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa. </P>  <P>(End videotape) </P>  <P>Mr. Russert: Now, five weeks later, this is what appeared in <EM>The Washington Post:</EM> ""A key piece of evidence linking Iraq to a nuclear weapons program appears to have been fabricated, the United Nations' chief nuclear inspector said in a report that called into question U.S. and British claims about Iraq's secret nuclear ambitions. Documents that purportedly showed Iraqi officials shopping for uranium in Africa two years ago were deemed 'not authentic' after careful scrutiny by U.N. and independent experts . . . 'We fell for it,' said one U.S. official [who reviewed the documents]."" </P>  <P>In light of that, should the president retract those comments? And should there be a full, open government investigation into our intelligence agencies? <BR><BR>Dr. Rice: The president quoted a British paper. We did not know at the time—no one knew at the time, in our circles—maybe someone knew down in the bowels of the agency, but no one in our circles knew that there were doubts and suspicions that this might be a forgery. Of course, it was information that was mistaken. But the—it was a relatively small part of the case about nuclear weapons and nuclear reconstitution. It is also the case that the broad picture about Iraq's programs was a picture that went very far back in time. Let me take for a minute that DIA report that you just talked about because there's a lot of selective quotation going on here.</P>",True,"Iraq, WMD, chemical, biological, nuclear, uranium, Al Qaeda, FS","Saddam Hussein, George W.

Normally on Sunday mornings, we come on opposite <EM>Meet the Press.</EM> It came on early this morning because of the French Open, so I had an opportunity, as I'm sure many of our viewers did, to hear you talk about some of these same things earlier. One of the things I heard you say this morning is that when the president and the vice president told us before the war with Iraq that Saddam Hussein posed this imminent threat at the United States, because he did have these weapons of mass destruction, you said at that point, though, that we—we were not certain where the weapons were. How could we have been certain that he had the weapons and they were still threatening if we didn't know where they were? <BR><BR>Dr. Rice: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>There was a preponderance of evidence and information gathered together in a disciplined process by the director of the central intelligence—director of central intelligence called a National Intelligence Estimate that talked about Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction. The judgment of the intelligence community was that he had weapons of mass destruction, that his programs were active and being reconstituted, that he was going to great lengths to conceal these programs from the international community. There were, of course, from weapons inspectors themselves, including from Hans Blix in his reports, discussions of the large quantities of missing agent, whether it was VX or—or sarin gas or mustard gas or anthrax—large quantities of missing agent.</SPAN> </P>  <P>It is a bit revisionist history now, because you have to go back not just to the 2002 report, but all the way back to 1996, when then-Dep—the director of central intelligence, John Deutch, talked about the weapons of mass destruction programs that Iraq had; in 1998, when President Clinton went to use military force against Iraq because of their weapons of mass destruction programs. </P>  <P>Schieffer: Well, let—let me just—let me just . . . <BR><BR>Dr. Rice: It's—there clearly was a very strong basis for this.

I think that the intelligence agencies had a plethora of data, al—many multiple sources. Other intelligence agencies had it.</SPAN> We had the last UNSCOM [United Nations Special Commission] report in 1999 that talked about these large quantities of missing agent. No, there was a lot of evidence. You know, in this town it became very de rigueur after September 11th to talk about connecting dots. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Well, there were hundreds and hundreds of dots about the Iraqi program. And just before the war, there were also reports about Saddam Hussein preparing to use weapons of mass destruction, and we found chemical suits, we found atropine injectors. No, this was a very clear picture. Now there was a policy judgment that the president had to make that this was a serious enough threat that it was time to finally do something about this serial abuser of U.N. resolutions. And it's quite clear to me that he was right to do what he did.</SPAN> </P>  <P>Ms. Wright: Let me ask you, there is a difference between the agents, the ingredients, for weapons of mass destruction and the weaponized warheads that can be used immediately. In justifying the war, the administration said the United States faced ""a threat,"" and implied an im—imminent threat. D—are you still confident that the administration is going to find those weaponized warheads rather than just the ingredients, which can be used for other things, from fertilizer to the ink for pens? <BR><BR>Dr. Rice: Well, given that in 1991 the—this regime had chemical weapons and, we believe, biological weapons weaponized, we know that they had the capability to do it. And, indeed, some chemical shells were found during the inspections. We know that there was information going in that they were preparing to disperse these weapons to—to troops in the field. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>We will find out the full extent of the Iraqi program. We will find out how he managed to deceive and conceal for 12 years. We've always known that the best information was going to come from discussions and interviews with scientists who were involved in the program. That's why we pushed so hard to have these scientists taken out of the country during the weapons inspection period. </P>  <P>We have thousands and thousands and thousands of documents that we've not yet gone through. We have many, many people. We've interviewed just a fraction of them. There are sites to—to visit. We will put together this whole picture, but the preponderance of evidence is that this was a—a regime that had the capability, that had unaccounted-for stockpiles and unaccounted-for weapons, and if you don't believe that was a threat to the United States, given his preponderance to—his—his preference for using them in the past and the nature of this regime, then you're not connecting the dots in a way that protected American security.</SPAN></P>",True,"Iraq, WMD, chemical, biological, nuclear, FS","Saddam Hussein, George W.

That statement was vetted thoroughly by all of the analysts who are responsible for this account. We spent four days and nights out at the CIA making sure that whatever I said was supported by our intelligence holdings, because it wasn't the president's credibility and my credibility on the line; it was the credibility of the United States of America. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>And we are sure of what we said because he does have this kind of capability. <BR><BR>Now, suddenly this week there's a big firestorm about, well, we haven't found anything yet. Well, we are going to intensify our search. In my statement, I also said they are masters of deception and hiding.</SPAN> So we are sending in an Iraqi survey group of 1,300 people who will be looking in all the places. They will be exploiting all the documents. They will be interviewing people. And I would put before you Exhibit A, the mobile biological labs that we have found. People are saying, ""Well, are they truly mobile biological labs?"" Yes, they are. And the DCI, George Tenet, Director of Central Intelligence, stands behind that assessment. <BR><BR>And my best justification for the fact that they are what we said they were, biological labs—as if they were not biological labs, I can assure you, the very next morning the Iraqis would have pulled them out and presented them to UNMOVIC [United Nations Monitoring, Verification, and Inspection Commission] and presented them to the whole international press corps to demonstrate what they were if they weren't that. <BR><BR>Mr. Snow: So you have no doubt that there were weapons before the war. How about now? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>There can be no question there were weapons before the war. They have had weapons throughout their history. They have used chemical weapons. They have admitted that they had biological weapons. And they never accounted for all that they had or what they might or might not have done with it. And it is the considered judgment not only of this administration, it was the judgment of President Clinton's administration, it's the judgment of a number of nations around the world, that they had these weapons. And when we passed [U.N.] Resolution 1441 unanimously, it was the unanimous judgment of the Security Council that Iraq was in violation of its obligations. <BR><BR>Now we have to do the intensive search that is ahead of us, and the Iraqi survey group will be doing that. And I'm sure more evidence and more proof will come forward as we go down this road.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Mr. Snow: There have been allegations in this town that the books were cooked. In fact, one of your former aides, Mr. [Greg]&nbsp;Thielmann, is quoted as saying that he does not believe that the evidence was fitting. Let's pull up his quote, if we can, just to see if—never mind, we don't have it with us so we're not going to pull up that quote. <BR><BR>In any event, there have been arguments that the intelligence was bogus and that, specifically, the vice president, by going over to the CIA, was, in fact, inflicting political pressure on people to alter and to doctor their assessments. True or false? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: False. I mean, the vice president, by going over to the CIA and spending a lot of time there, was delving in, as I know [Vice President] Dick Cheney does—I've worked with him for many years. He delves into a subject. He wants to get to the bottom. He wants to get to the truth. <BR><BR>And I have heard no suggestion that he went over there and said, ""This is the answer I want."" He went over there to learn. I can tell you stories from the Gulf War back in 1991, the first Gulf War, when he was my boss, the secretary of defense, and I was chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. He did the same thing with me. He would bore in and bore in on our military plans and what we were doing. It's his style to make sure that he has all the information available to us in his mind so he knows what he's talking about. That isn't politicizing. That's doing a good job. <BR><BR>Mr. Snow: On Capitol Hill, a number of people have said throughout that they were promised intelligence that would make it beyond a shadow of a doubt clear to them that Saddam possessed weapons of mass destruction, and they're saying that they never got that. <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: No, no, please. They were briefed consistently and repeatedly throughout last year. George Tenet was up testifying. John McLaughlin went up there repeatedly. We have presented information. We have put out classified documents that the Central Intelligence Agency has. We have given briefings up on the Hill. I presume Congress knew what it was doing when it passed the resolution supporting the president last fall, and so if Congress needs more information now to reaffirm their judgment of last year, the administration stands ready to provide all the information that we have. <BR><BR>Mr. Snow: Have you seen the Defense Intelligence Agency report that assessed— <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: I've seen the summary that has made all the news. <BR><BR>Mr. Snow: The summary that has made the news indicates that as of September the DIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, was unable to pinpoint production sources for weapons of mass destruction and, furthermore, was unable to find any battlefield deployments. True? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: No, not true. The sentence that has gotten all of the attention in this two-page unclassified summary talked about not having the evidence of current facilities and current stockpiling. The very next sentence says that it had information that weapons had been dispersed to units, chemical weapons had been dispersed to units. So there was a question as to whether or not you're talking about chemical weapons that are being dispersed or the production facility, and there is a judgment call there. <BR><BR>But the considered judgment and the official judgment of the Director of Central Intelligence, who is the one responsible for gathering all this information and making a judgment, is that they had weapons of mass destruction of the kind that we had described: nuclear, nuclear capability in the form of individuals with the knowledge and the commitment on the part of Saddam Hussein to continue moving toward a nuclear capability even though he didn't—he wasn't close to one at the time, we don't believe; chemical weapons and biological facilities of the kind we have demonstrated with this lab. <BR><BR>Mr. Snow: You've talked about making available to Congress information. What about to the American public? When is the public going to see more of the kind of intelligence that led you and other senior White House officials to believe that Saddam had— <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: Tony, I think we've put out a lot, and my presentation on the 5th of February was unclassified, on television live around the country and the world. I think the American people got a good, solid assessment. I boiled down what could have been a presentation of many, many hours and days to one hour and roughly 20 minutes, <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>where I presented the best information we had on weapons of mass destruction, on the terrorist activities of this regime, and the human rights abuses of this regime. And I stand by that presentation and there is much more information that is available.</SPAN> <BR><BR>And I'm sure that as the intelligence community feels that it is appropriate to declassify this information, it will be made available to the public. I don't think the public is as upset about all this, or as concerned about this, as is the media, which has had a feeding frenzy for the last week.</P>",True,"Iraq, WMD, chemical, biological, nuclear, FS","Saddam Hussein, George W.

I can show you reports from U.N. inspectors all through the 1990s that demonstrated that the Iraqis had weapons of mass destruction. I can show you reports where the Iraqis were caught lying about their weapons of mass destruction. You tell me why they issued a false declaration when they had the opportunity to tell the truth. <BR><BR>And so I think the case is clear. The case has been substantiated over the years.

Let me play for you what President Bush said on September 26th in the Rose Garden. Listen to this: </P>  <P>""The Iraqi regime possesses biological and chemical weapons. The Iraqi regime is building the facilities necessary to make more biological and chemical weapons."" <BR><BR>And this followed a DIA, a Defense Intelligence Agency report, among other things, one sentence in there said this: ""There is no reliable information on whether Iraq is producing and stockpiling chemical weapons or where Iraq has or will establish its chemical warfare agent production facilities."" <BR><BR>That nuanced, as all intelligence assessments usually are. But the president was categorical. Did he go too far, and did you subsequently go too far when you testified or spoke before the U.N. Security Council? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: No. The DIA sentence you made reference to is taken out of context in all of the reporting. The very next sentence after the sentence that says we're not sure what they're doing, says we have information that they have transferred chemical weapons within the last few weeks. Let's put this in context and then I'll get to my presentation on the 5th of February. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Iraq had chemical weapons. They used chemical weapons. They had biological weapons. The admitted it. We have no doubt whatsoever that over the last several years they have retained such weapons, they have retained the capability to start up production of such weapons.</SPAN> And the presentation I gave on the 5th of February before the United Nations Security Council, I spent four whole days and nights at the CIA going over all the intelligence in order to make sure that what I presented was going to be solid, credible, representing the views of the United States of America.

And, voila, the vans showed up a few months later. We found them. So slowly but surely, we are finding that capability. <BR><BR>Now people are debating whether or not these vans truly are biological vans. Sure they are. What other purpose are there? And let me give you the killer argument as to why these vans are exactly what I said they were and what the intelligence community said they were: I can assure you that if those biological vans were not biological vans when I said they were on the 5th of February, on the 6th of February Iraq would have hauled those vans out, put them in front of a press conference, gave them to the UNMOVIC [United Nations Monitoring, Verification, and Inspection Commission] inspectors to try to drive a stake in the heart of my presentation. They did not. The reason they did not is they knew what they were. <BR><BR>And the intelligence community has reviewed all of the comments that have come in about those vans and reaffirmed yesterday to me again, through [CIA] Director [George] Tenet, that they are confident of their judgment, they are confident that these vans are exactly what we said they were. <BR><BR>So there's no question that Iraq has this capability and has tried to hide it from the world. This is not only the judgment of the president and the secretary of state; it's the judgment of the United Nations that they had this capability, it's the judgment of every nation that voted for the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441, it was the judgment of the previous administration.

How does this affect U.S. beliefs and priorities in the region? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: I think that, over time, people in Latin America will realize that the United States took the correct action in dealing with Iraq. A terrible dictator who poisoned his own people with gas, who suppressed his people, who wasted their money on weapons and on threatening neighbors and on creating huge armies—a huge army and military force—is no longer there. I hope the people of Latin America will watch these pictures we are now seeing of mass graves—tens upon tens of thousands who were murdered by Saddam Hussein—and they will come perhaps to a different judgment as to whether the United States and its Coalition partners acted correctly. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>I think we did act correctly.

The United States only wants to make friends and partners around the world, not enemies. The wars we have had to fight in recent years—whether it was Gulf War I, Gulf War II, whether it was Kosovo, or whether it was what we did in Afghanistan—all of these were for the purpose of either putting down an enemy that was destroying innocent life, in the case of Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, or we were saving Muslim nations or Muslim populations from assault from other Muslim nations, in some cases, and we were coming to the rescue of Muslims.

They're in the area around Tikrit and Baghdad and east, west, south and north somewhat."" <BR><BR>Yesterday, Bush also expressed irritation about a <EM>New York Times</EM> article yesterday reporting that two of the highest-ranking Al Qaeda leaders in custody have told the CIA that the Iraqi government did not work with the terrorist group. Bush pointed to the involvement of ""al Zarqawi's network"" in the killing of a U.S. diplomat. </P>  <P>Although the Bush administration painted Abu Musab Zarqawi, head of a terrorist group called al Tawhid, as a central Al Qaeda figure, the CIA viewed him as ""affiliated with Al Qaeda,"" meaning he had associated with some Al Qaeda members but had his own agenda. </P>  <P>The CIA ""always said, 'We can't make the connection, we can't take you there,'"" said a senior administration official. As for an ""operational connection"" between Al Qaeda and Iraq, the CIA ""didn't ever tell the administration; there was one before the war."" </P>  <P>More broadly, some intelligence officials said they were surprised at how definitive the Bush administration was in public about the links between Al Qaeda and Iraq. Al Qaeda operative Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who was captured shortly before the war began, told his interrogators that Al Qaeda did not work with Iraq. ""The people I worked with were flabbergasted by statements coming out of the White House about the links to terrorism,"" said an intelligence expert on Capitol Hill. </P>  <P>CIA officials viewed these statements with skepticism, because they came from captured Al Qaeda figures whose verifiable information was often false. But they passed them on to policymakers in summaries of interrogation debriefings. That intelligence became a source of frustration for some lawmakers who knew the information cast doubt on the administration's case linking Iraq with terrorism. But because the information was classified, they were not permitted to share those doubts with the public.</P>",False,"Iraq, WMD, nuclear, uranium, Al Qaeda","Saddam Hussein, George W.

The case you made at the U.N. centered around actual weapons, actual chemicals that Iraq was thought to have. And now it seems in defending the military action in Iraq, the emphasis is on a weapons programs, why that rhetorical shift? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: First of all, if you go back and read my transcript of my presentation, you will see that I spoke to all elements. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>I spoke to the presence of weapons. I also spoke to gaps in knowledge, what previous inspections said they might have and did have and what happened to it. Where is it now? And we also talked about programs, so we were interested in all aspects of it. <BR><BR>The biological weapons labs that we believe strongly are biological weapons labs, we didn't find any biological weapons with those labs. But should that give us any comfort? Not at all. Those were labs that could produce biological weapons whenever Saddam Hussein might have wanted to have a biological weapons inventory.</SPAN> <BR><BR>So I think you have to look at both, the weapons themselves and the exploitation efforts that we have underway are going continue. And we are going to look at every part of that country, every bunker that we can get into, every bunker we find. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>And we are going to examine all of the documents. And we are going to conduct interviews that will lead us, not only, we believe, to weapons that still exist, but to the programs themselves, we want to find and rip up weapons and programs, and want to make sure we know what intelligence exists within Iraqi society. There are nuclear scientists there. <BR><BR>Saddam Hussein kept them together so that if the opportunity presented itself, he could recreate a nuclear program.</SPAN> We want to make sure those scientists are no longer kept together in a cell, a cell of scientists working together, but that they go on and find other things to do with the information they have inside of their head and with their intelligence. <BR><BR>Question: But it doesn't seem that anyone wants to actually say right now that they are confident there were actual weapons in Iraq. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Secretary Powell: We believe there were weapons in Iraq. We have solid judgment of the intelligence community behind us. And we believe in due course, when the exploitation is completed — by exploitation I mean sending in the large team that is prepared to go in now, some 1,300 people—when their work is done, the world will see what we were talking about.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Question: The credibility clich? that somehow credibility has been damaged, U.S. credibility? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>I don't think so. I think our credibility is intact. I think that we will be able to demonstrate convincingly through the mobile labs, through documentation, through interviews, through what we find, that we knew what we were speaking about. <BR><BR>But let's go back a little further. It is not just the United States that made a claim on the 5th of February, when I made my presentation. Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, used weapons of mass destruction. It was documented over a period of many years.</SPAN> <BR><BR>At the end of the first Gulf War in '91, we found weapons of mass destruction and destroyed those we found. As late as 1998, there was no question in anyone's mind. President Clinton spoke out forcefully. His intelligence leaders, his director of Central Intelligence said that there were weapons. Other intelligence organizations in other countries have said so, so this isn't a figment of somebody's imagination. <BR><BR>This isn't something that was overblown or made up in the basement of the CIA late one night. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>These were real weapons and real programs that Saddam Hussein refused to come forward and explain to the world. And if he didn't have weapons of mass destruction, it would have been an easy thing for him to make an honest declaration after 1441 resolution was passed. And it would have been easy for him to come forward and say, ""Here, go anywhere, any time, any place, I'll provide anything you want"" as opposed to continuing these deception efforts. <BR><BR>If he didn't have weapons of mass destruction or the capability to produce them, on the 6th of February, you tell me why, after watching me make this presentation and go on at some length about this van that we had never seen, but we believe existed, why didn't he come out the next day, pull that thing out in front of the whole world press corps and say, ""Powell doesn't know what he is talking about. Here it is and we use it to make hydrogen gas for birthday balloons or weather balloons."" He didn't do that. He kept it hidden. He brought back—he brought out all kinds of other vans to try to deceive us, but this van was kept hidden. <BR><BR>Why? Do you want to give Saddam Hussein the benefit of the doubt? Well, we didn't, and now we don't have to worry about it anymore.

I'm trying to respond to your question. I don't know anybody in any government or any intelligence agency who suggested that the Iraqis had nuclear weapons. That's fact number one. If you go back to my statement, we also know that the Iraqis did have chemical weapons. They confessed to having had all of these weapons over a sustained period of time. I brought something along. In the '90s, Iraq admitted having 8,500 liters of anthrax and several tons of VX. Iraq admitted producing 6,500 chemical bombs containing an estimated 1,000 tons of chemical agents, none of which have ever been accounted for. In 1998, President Clinton said Saddam Hussein possessed 5,000 gallons of botulin, 2,000 gallons of anthrax, and 177 Scud warheads, and bombs filled with biological agents. We know he used chemical weapons against the Kurds and against the Iranians in the war. So you had a country that had these weapons and programs, a country that used those weapons, a country that by everyone who had reason to be knowledgeable believed filed a fraudulent declaration to the United Nations. And it seems to me that that speaks for itself, that they— <BR><BR>Question: But isn't it possible, now in retrospect, that Saddam Hussein could have destroyed the weapons—that is, destroyed the evidence—while maintaining the programs to produce them in the future, in an effort to ride out the sanctions, and that as a result, you may never find any actual weapons in Iraq? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: I'm not going to get into the various possibilities. They're fairly self-evident as to what the possibilities might be. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>I have reason, every reason, to believe that the intelligence that we were operating off was correct and that we will, in fact, find weapons or evidence of weapons programs that are conclusive.

1047,2003-06-26,"Secretary of State Colin Powell, Remarks With Spanish Foreign Minister Ana Palacio","Question: Mr. Secretary, you alluded to this in your presentation to George Schultz about members of the State Department who voiced dissent in terms of pressure that they might have felt to tailor any evidence about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Do you think that this went on in the Department? And what do you think of Mr. [Christian] Westermann's speaking and, through Congress, speaking out about any pressure that he felt? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: Yes. There are always debates about intelligence subjects. You get information in, and there are debates. And Mr. Westermann was in a debate with other members of the Department on some of the intelligence information. And when he was asked about it, he said that he felt that he was under pressure at that time. <BR><BR>I think what's important to note, though, is that he didn't find that there was any need to yield to that pressure, and he didn't change any of his opinions or any of his assessments. And I called his superior yesterday to make sure that—Carl Ford, the director of INR [State Department Bureau of Intelligence and Research]—and I called Mr. Ford to make sure that he communicated to Mr. Westermann that I was pleased that when asked a question by a member of the Congress, he honestly answered that question, and he should not feel that he is either under any pressure or any threat for having done what he was morally required to do as a member of the Department. <BR><BR>Question: Are you afraid that, perhaps, the State Department analysts', intelligence analysts' opinions are given short shrift to other members of the administration? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: No, not at all. My—if you're referring to the other story that was in <EM>The New York Times</EM> today, the INR Bureau advised me on 2 June, as the story said, that they didn't have the same level of assurance and confidence in what the intelligence community was saying about the mobile labs as the intelligence community did. <BR><BR>They weren't disagreeing with the intelligence community in the sense that they weren't saying it wasn't a mobile lab. They just were not quite up on that curve of confidence that the rest of the intelligence community was at. And so when they reported this to me as they should—they are supposed to tell me things like this when they have a judgment of this nature—and I immediately had—I was in the Middle East—and I immediately had my deputy, Rich Armitage, communicate this point of view to the director of Central Intelligence. And the factors that caused my folks to have not quite the same level of confidence were known to the intelligence community and the DCI and were factored into their assessment. And the DCI, who is the person who makes the final judgment on such matters, felt confident about the judgment that he had made. And I felt confident about the judgment that he had made, but I appreciated the fact that the experts in my Department were expressing their opinion to me. And that opinion was taken into account, and it was passed to the intelligence community for them to take that opinion into account. That's the way this system is supposed to work, and I am pleased that it worked that way. <BR><BR>Question: Mr. Secretary, but do you feel that political pressure has been put on you— <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: What political pressure? <BR><BR>Question: Any political pressure? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: No. No. <BR><BR>Question: —information? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: No. You're leading the witness. I'm the one who went to the United Nations on the 5th of February and presented the intelligence case that the United States had developed. And as we saw from some of nuclear information that came out yesterday, which you've all had a chance to see, slowly but surely, we are providing more evidence. I don't know that we needed more evidence, but we're providing evidence on the ground that makes the case that we made that day. <BR><BR>What I said that day with respect to the nuclear account, the nuclear problem, was that they had brain power, they had plans, and they had never lost sight of their goal, which was to develop a nuclear weapon, and if they ever had the chance to restart, they would restart. And that's what I presented. And we talked about the centrifuges, and I said there are two schools of thought about the centrifuges. We have one. Others have another. Let us continue to examine this issue. <BR><BR>And frankly, from what I've seen in the following months on that issue, anyway, I think the presentation holds up, and I have never felt that I have been under any political pressure to say anything that was not supported by the intelligence community or that I didn't believe. <BR><BR>The president asked me to go and make that presentation.

In a classified June 2 memorandum, the officials said, the department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research said it was premature to conclude that the trailers were evidence of an Iraqi biological weapons program, as President Bush has done. The disclosure of the memorandum is the clearest sign yet of disagreement between intelligence agencies over the assertion, which was produced jointly by the CIA and the Defense Intelligence Agency and made public on May 28 on the CIA Web site.

1050,2003-06-27,"Secretary of State Colin Powell, Interview on NPR's <EM>All Things Considered</EM>","Ms. Block: I'd like to turn to the mobile trailers that have been found in Iraq. You, back in your speech in February before the U.N., called the possibility of these mobile labs one of the most worrisome things that you saw in the Saddam Hussein regime. And the CIA and the Defense analysts have concluded that these were mobile weapons labs. But your own State Department intelligence analysts disagreed. They're not convinced. <BR><BR>So who's right? Is it your own analysts or is it the CIA? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: My analysts do not disagree. They do not say that they are not mobile vans. What my analysts said to me about, oh, almost a month ago now, was that they were not at the same confidence level as the CIA and the DIA. And when they said to me, ""Boss, you know, we are not entirely sure yet, and therefore we would like to see more analysis done,"" we passed that on to the CIA to let them know that there was this opinion. A month has now passed since that memo. My guys would still like to see more data. <BR><BR>The CIA and the Defense Intelligence Agency, the DIA, are the ones who were on the scene exploiting [sic]&nbsp;the van and looking at all of it. And they are confident of their judgment. And their judgment, as validated by the director of Central Intelligence, is that's what they are. They are mobile biological warfare facilities. And there will always be, you know, different judgments and opinions in this business, and you essentially have to have somebody who makes the decision. And the person is the director of Central Intelligence, George Tenet. And that is his opinion right now. <BR><BR>Will we continue to look for more information to reinforce our opinion? Sure, we will. But I am confident with the judgment made by the CIA, and the reason I'm confident of that judgment is, we got this information through defectors and others. And when I presented it to the U.N. on the 5th of February, all I could show was a cartoon picture of what we thought it looked like based on what people said to us. And guess what? We found something that looked just like that. And nobody has been able to come up with an alternative use for this. But we're still looking at it, but I'm fairly confident of the director of Central Intelligence's judgment. <BR><BR>Ms. Block: There were no toxins found in those trailers. <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: Which could mean one of several things: one, they hadn't been used yet to develop toxins; or, secondly, they had been sterilized so thoroughly that there is no residual left. It may well be that they hadn't been used yet. <BR><BR>Our concern was that Iraq was keeping in place this capability, waiting for the day when they were free of sanctions and could go about putting all of their programs back in place. This particularly applies to the nuclear program. What I said in February when I spoke to the U.N., was that they had the brainpower, they had the plans, and they were working on acquiring the capability, and whenever they were free of U.N. constraints or other constraints—nobody was breathing down their neck—there was no doubt in my mind Saddam Hussein still had the intention of developing such a capability. <BR><BR>And as we have seen from material that's come forward in the last couple of days, and we've seen on television and in papers, we now have seen the plans, we have seen the scientists who said this is what he was supposed to be working on, and he was told to hide this material until times were better to get the program up and running again. That was the concern we had with Saddam Hussein. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Not only did he have weapons—and we'll uncover not only his weapons but all of his weapons programs—he never lost the intent to have these kinds of weapons.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Ms. Block: Was he an imminent threat? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: The imminent threat is we don't know. The imminent threat is that suddenly, this biological warfare lab, for example, could have been put into use. And the possibility that anything that came out of that lab or any of the chemical capability he had could have been given to terrorist organizations. And the point well, should we wait until we see a chemical device exploded or turned loose or some toxin released in London or Paris or Frankfurt or New York or Los Angeles and then decide we have an imminent threat? Or should we act when we know that there is a regime that has said, ""We are not going to tell you what we have been doing for 12 years. We are not going to turn over our programs. We are simply going to ignore 12 years' worth of U.N. resolutions, and we are going to do what we want to do, and we don't care what the international community thinks; we're going to develop these evil weapons."" In this case, the international community spoke. Now, there was a great deal of debate toward the end as to what one should do about this. And we decided that military action was appropriate. Others in the Security Council thought military action was premature or wasn't appropriate at all. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>But nevertheless, nobody in the Security Council thought that Saddam Hussein was not developing these weapons or did not have these weapons. That's why the Security Council unanimously passed the first resolution, called 1441. There was no disagreement with France or Britain or Spain or Russia or China that Iraq had this kind of capability, and they did. And it's now coming forward, and I think it will be even more people as we exploit [sic] documents that we have in our possession, and more are coming forward. The case will be obvious to all once again.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Ms. Block: In your speech to the U.N. in February, you also talked about a sinister nexus between the Iraqi regime and Al Qaeda. The U.N. group that's tracking Al Qaeda has seen no evidence of such a link. How do you explain that? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: I made a presentation that talked about a specific link between the man by the name of [Abu Musab] al-Zarqawi, who was in Baghdad, and I think that link is solid. It was solid at the time that I presented it, and it is still of concern to us. In my presentation, I did not stretch the intelligence to suggest that we knew about all linkages between Al Qaeda and Iran [sic]. I think there's still a lot we don't know, but I did take note at the U.N., of the U.N. presentation this week that they have not found a concrete link.

In February 2002, I was informed by officials at the Central Intelligence Agency that Vice President Dick Cheney's office had questions about a particular intelligence report. While I never saw the report, I was told that it referred to a memorandum of agreement that documented the sale of uranium yellowcake—a form of lightly processed ore—by Niger to Iraq in the late 1990's. The agency officials asked if I would travel to Niger to check out the story so they could provide a response to the vice president's office. </P>  <P>After consulting with the State Department's African Affairs Bureau (and through it with Barbro Owens-Kirkpatrick, the United States ambassador to Niger), I agreed to make the trip. The mission I undertook was discreet but by no means secret. While the CIA paid my expenses (my time was offered pro bono), I made it abundantly clear to everyone I met that I was acting on behalf of the United States government. In late February 2002, I arrived in Niger's capital, Niamey, where I had been a diplomat in the mid-70's and visited as a National Security Council official in the late 90's. The city was much as I remembered it. Seasonal winds had clogged the air with dust and sand. Through the haze, I could see camel caravans crossing the Niger River (over the John F. Kennedy bridge), the setting sun behind them. Most people had wrapped scarves around their faces to protect against the grit, leaving only their eyes visible. </P>  <P>The next morning, I met with Ambassador Owens-Kirkpatrick at the embassy. For reasons that are understandable, the embassy staff has always kept a close eye on Niger's uranium business. I was not surprised, then, when the ambassador told me that she knew about the allegations of uranium sales to Iraq—and that she felt she had already debunked them in her reports to Washington. Nevertheless, she and I agreed that my time would be best spent interviewing people who had been in government when the deal supposedly took place, which was before her arrival. I spent the next eight days drinking sweet mint tea and meeting with dozens of people: current government officials, former government officials, people associated with the country's uranium business. It did not take long to conclude that it was highly doubtful that any such transaction had ever taken place. Given the structure of the consortiums that operated the mines, it would be exceedingly difficult for Niger to transfer uranium to Iraq. Niger's uranium business consists of two mines, Somair and Cominak, which are run by French, Spanish, Japanese, German and Nigerian interests. If the government wanted to remove uranium from a mine, it would have to notify the consortium, which in turn is strictly monitored by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Moreover, because the two mines are closely regulated, quasi-governmental entities, selling uranium would require the approval of the minister of mines, the prime minister and probably the president. In short, there's simply too much oversight over too small an industry for a sale to have transpired. </P>  <P>(As for the actual memorandum, I never saw it. But news accounts have pointed out that the documents had glaring errors—they were signed, for example, by officials who were no longer in government—and were probably forged. And then there's the fact that Niger formally denied the charges.) Before I left Niger, I briefed the ambassador on my findings, which were consistent with her own. I also shared my conclusions with members of her staff. In early March, I arrived in Washington and promptly provided a detailed briefing to the CIA I later shared my conclusions with the State Department African Affairs Bureau. There was nothing secret or earth-shattering in my report, just as there was nothing secret about my trip. </P>  <P>Though I did not file a written report, there should be at least four documents in United States government archives confirming my mission. The documents should include the ambassador's report of my debriefing in Niamey, a separate report written by the embassy staff, a CIA report summing up my trip, and a specific answer from the agency to the Office of the Vice President (this may have been delivered orally). While I have not seen any of these reports, I have spent enough time in government to know that this is standard operating procedure. I thought the Niger matter was settled and went back to my life. (I did take part in the Iraq debate, arguing that a strict containment regime backed by the threat of force was preferable to an invasion.) In September 2002, however, Niger re-emerged. The British government published a ""white paper"" asserting that Saddam Hussein and his unconventional arms posed an immediate danger. As evidence, the report cited Iraq's attempts to purchase uranium from an African country. Then, in January, President Bush, citing the British dossier, repeated the charges about Iraqi efforts to buy uranium from Africa. </P>  <P>The next day, I reminded a friend at the State Department of my trip and suggested that if the president had been referring to Niger, then his conclusion was not borne out by the facts as I understood them. He replied that perhaps the president was speaking about one of the other three African countries that produce uranium: Gabon, South Africa or Namibia. At the time, I accepted the explanation. I didn't know that in December, a month before the president's address, the State Department had published a fact sheet that mentioned the Niger case. Those are the facts surrounding my efforts. The vice president's office asked a serious question. I was asked to help formulate the answer. I did so, and I have every confidence that the answer I provided was circulated to the appropriate officials within our government. </P>  <P>The question now is how that answer was or was not used by our political leadership. If my information was deemed inaccurate, I understand (though I would be very interested to know why). If, however, the information was ignored because it did not fit certain preconceptions about Iraq, then a legitimate argument can be made that we went to war under false pretenses. (It's worth remembering that in his March <EM>Meet the Press</EM> appearance, Mr. Cheney said that Saddam Hussein was ""trying once again to produce nuclear weapons."") At a minimum, Congress, which authorized the use of military force at the president's behest, should want to know if the assertions about Iraq were warranted.</P>",False,"Iraq, WMD, uranium, nuclear","Saddam Hussein, George W.

And should the administration beat Congress to the punch by making a detailed investigation and a detailed explanation of how something so important and so wrong got into a presidential address? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: I think this is very overwrought and overblown and overdrawn. Intelligence reports flow in from all over. Sometimes they are results of your own intelligence agencies at work. Sometimes you get information from very capable foreign intelligence services. And you get the information, you analyze it. Sometimes it holds up, sometimes it does not hold up. It's a moving train. And you keep trying to establish what is right and what is wrong. Very often it never comes out quite that clean, but you have to make judgments. <BR><BR>And at the time of the president's State of the Union address, a judgment was made that that was an appropriate statement for the president to make. There was no effort or attempt on the part of the president, or anyone else in the administration, to mislead or to deceive the American people. The president was presenting what seemed to be a reasonable statement at that time—and it didn't talk to Niger, it talked specifically about efforts to acquire uranium from nations that had it in Africa. <BR><BR>Subsequently, when we looked at it more thoroughly and when I think it's, oh, a week or two later, when I made my presentation to the United Nations and we really went through every single thing we knew about all of the various issues with respect to weapons of mass destruction, we did not believe that it was appropriate to use that example anymore. It was not standing the test of time. And so I didn't use it, and we haven't used it since. <BR><BR>But to think that somehow we went out of our way to insert this single sentence into the State of the Union address for the purpose of deceiving and misleading the American people is an overdrawn, overblown, overwrought conclusion. <BR><BR>Question: So can I follow that up—some British officials apparently think that what will happen in the end is weapons of mass destruction will not be found. There may be evidence that Saddam Hussein, before the war, either hid or destroyed weapons of mass destruction. Is that now what this administration thinks? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: No. And I cannot speculate on what an unnamed British official may or may not have said, or does or does not believe. Let's start at the beginning. I don't want to take you through the whole history, but it's instructive. <BR><BR>This is a regime that developed weapons of mass destruction, had them, used them, and in 1991, when we went to war, and I was chairman of the joint chiefs of staff at the time, we were concerned that they would use those weapons against them—against us, and everybody knew they had them. <BR><BR>When the first Gulf war was over, Desert Storm, we found them, and we destroyed some. And we looked for more. And the U.N. took it over, and for years the U.N. kept searching for more. And they never were able to get a full accounting and could not find them all. Resolution after resolution was passed, agreed to by the entire international community. <BR><BR>In 1998, Saddam Hussein created conditions that caused the inspectors to have to leave. They were getting close, and they had to leave. President Clinton was so concerned at time that he bombed. What did he bomb? He bombed for four days, in Operation Desert Fox, facilities that were believed to possess or developing or producing weapons of mass destruction. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>The entire international community has felt, over this entire period, that Saddam Hussein had these weapons, and there was sufficient intelligence available to all the major intelligence agencies of the world that they existed. And they do exist. And when we went to the United Nations last year, when the president spoke to the United Nations General Assembly last September, he put the charge to the General Assembly: you have been saying; put the charge to the Security Council as well, you have been saying for all these years that this is a nation that has not come clean, here is one last chance. <BR><BR>And in resolution 1441, 15 nations unanimously approved that resolution that begins with a statement that Iraq is in material breach. So everybody had reason to believe, good reason to believe—not figments of the imagination—that they had weapons of mass destruction and had programs to develop more. And if there is anybody who thinks that Saddam Hussein had ever lost the intent to have such weapons, then I think that is the most naive view imaginable. And he had the chance to come clean to the international community; he did not take that chance, he did not take that opportunity. And the war followed. <BR><BR>And we have now removed a tyrant, a dictator. We have freed people. We have found the mass graves. We have found—we are starting to find evidence that I think will make it clear that there was a more than adequate justification for this war and more than adequate authority for it under Resolution 1441.</SPAN>",True,"Iraq, WMD, uranium, nuclear, FS","Saddam Hussein, George W.

1069,2003-07-12,White House Press Briefing by Ari Fleischer,"<P>Question: Ari, the president often speaks of accountability. Does he feel accountability is achieved in this circumstance? Or how do you address that issue? </P>  <P>Mr. Fleischer: Let me explain to you the president's thinking on this. A greater, more important truth is being lost in the flap over whether or not Iraq was seeking uranium from Africa. The greater truth is that nobody, but nobody, denies that Saddam Hussein was seeking nuclear weapons. He was pursuing numerous ways to obtain nuclear weapons. The United States never said that he had nuclear weapons. We have said that he was pursuing them. It should surprise nobody that Saddam Hussein was seeking to acquire the means to produce from a variety of sources and a variety of ways. </P>  <P>He had previously obtained yellowcake from Africa. In fact, in one of the least known parts of this story, which is now, for the first time, public—and you find this in Director Tenet's statement last night—the official that—lower-level official sent from the CIA to Niger to look into whether or not Saddam Hussein had sought yellowcake from Niger, [Joseph] Wilson, he—and Director Tenet's statement last night states the same former official, Wilson, also said that in June 1999 a businessman approached him and insisted that the former official, Wilson, meet an Iraqi delegation to discuss expanding commercial relations between Iraq and Niger. The former official interpreted the overture as an attempt to discuss uranium sales. </P>  <P>This is in Wilson's report back to the CIA. Wilson's own report, the very man who was on television saying Niger denies it, who never said anything about forged documents, reports himself that officials in Niger said that Iraq was seeking to contact officials in Niger about sales. </P>  <P>What did the president say in the State of the Union? He said: according to British reports, Iraq is seeking uranium from Africa. And the intelligence cited two other countries, in addition to Niger. </P>  <P>So, again, the larger truth, was Saddam Hussein a threat, in part because he was seeking nuclear weapons, in addition to what we know and have said about chemical and biological. </P>  <P>Now, if you ask, how the president is approaching this, what's the president's approach, the president sees this as much ado, that it's beside the point of the central threat that Saddam Hussein presented. <BR><BR>Question: But doesn't that make it all the more important that some accountability be achieved that this flap over one fact can obscure his larger message? </P>  <P>Mr. Fleischer: The president's larger message has not been obscured. The American people continue to agree that Saddam Hussein was a threat and— <BR><BR>Question: You just said it was being obscured. You said there's a larger truth here that's being missed. </P>  <P>Mr. Fleischer: Yes, but the larger truth—the larger truth being missed this week, but it's not been missed by the country on a longer-term basis.</P>",False,"Iraq, WMD, chemical, biological, nuclear, uranium","Saddam Hussein, George W.

1070,2003-07-13,"National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, Interview on CBS's <EM>Face the Nation</EM>","<P>Bob Schieffer: Very serious questions this morning. As you know, the—the topic, how did this statement ""The British government says it has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa,"" a statement that turns out to be based on false, forged documents, how did that wind up in the president's State of the Union message? The CIA director, George Tenet, said yesterday, of course, that he takes the blame for not removing it from the speech. The question I have for you this morning, who put it into the speech? <BR><BR>Dr. Rice: Well, let's start at the very beginning, as they say, and the president of the United States—the notion that the president of the United States took the country to war because he was concerned with one sentence about whether Saddam Hussein sought uranium in Africa is purely ludicrous, and this has gotten to that proportion, that people are saying this statement is why the president took the ni—nation to war. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>The president took the nation to war to depose a bloody tyrant who had defied the world for 12 years, who was building a weapons of mass destruction program and had weapons of mass destruction, which he had used in the past, who was a threat to American interest in the Middle East and who, now that he is removed, is giving us an opportunity for a Middle East that might finally be at peace and that will not create an atmosphere in which you have ideologies of hatred spawning people who slam airplanes into the World Trade Center. So we do have to put this in perspective.</SPAN> <BR><BR>The president's State of the Union said something that was accurate. This is what the British government said in its reporting. The British, I might note, still stand by that statement. It was not based, they say, on a single source but on other sources. The statement about Saddam Hussein seeking uranium in Africa is also in the national intelligence estimate. So it was not out of thin air that this statement came into the president's speech. We use a lot of data points. We give them to writers. They—they go to speeches, and then we rely on a clearance process. Now the statements here were based on intelligence. The reason that we have said is that—the reason that we've said is knowing what we know now, we would not have put it in the president's speech . . . </P>  <P>Schieffer: Yes. <BR><BR>Dr. Rice: . . . is because we don't believe that it rises to the quality of intelligence reporting that we use in presidential spees—speeches. It's not that it's inaccurate. It's not that it's wrong. The British stand by it. We have no reason to believe that they are wrong about that. But we use the clearance process to ask the relevant agencies . . . <BR><BR>Schieffer: Yes. <BR><BR>Dr. Rice: . . . Bob, we asked them, will you stand by this statement? Do you have confidence in this statement? And that's the point which if any agency does not have confidence in a statement, the president is going to make, we don't have the president make that statement. <BR><BR>Schieffer: I appreciate all of that, Dr. Rice. But you say the statement was—we don't know that it was wrong. The intelligence agencies were saying that they didn't—they did not have confidence in the statement. We now know, according to government officials, that Mr. Tenet actually went to people and got the statement—statement saying that removed from a speech the president made in October. You're going to say it's different, that that was more specific. <BR><BR>Dr. Rice: Bob, it—it is different. It is different, and it's on a different basis. <BR><BR>Schieffer: But you changed it from being more specific because you didn't . . . <BR><BR>Dr. Rice: It's—it's . . . <BR><BR>Schieffer: . . . you couldn't . . . <BR><BR>Dr. Rice: It's different and it's on a different basis. And in fact the Cincinnati speech was based on a single report and a single incident. And George Tenet said, ""I want that out."" It came out without question. <BR><BR>Schieffer: But who wanted it in the speech? Why was . . . <BR><BR>Dr. Rice: The State of the Union . . . <BR><BR>Schieffer: . . . it so important to put this statement into the speech? <BR><BR>Dr. Rice: The State of the Union—it—and, in fact, Bob, it's in a long list of other things that relate to Saddam Hussein's nuclear program and his efforts at reconstitution. It is one data point in a long story about acquisition programs, about illegal procurement programs, about kaying [sic]—keeping scientist networks together. It isn't, in fact, the key element of this argument, and, frankly, we would have been—it would have been quite odd for us to put something in the president's speech that we knew to be faulty. <BR><BR>Schieffer: But I still go back to the fact, if—if—if it was all that you say it is, why was it—why were people in the government so insistent this was not something that slipped through the cracks? This was something that was an object and a subject of serious debate within the administration, about whether or not it was true, and yet people kept insisting and it finally winds up . . . <BR><BR>Dr. Rice: Bob, it kept appearing in various intelligence documents like the national intelligence estimate. It appeared in the British statement, the British document, which is, in fact, what is cited in the president's speech. The British document was based not just on a set of documents that we later on in March and April learned to be forgeries, but on other documents that the British had and other sources that the British had. The national intelligence estimate didn't talk only about Niger, it talked about other African countries as well. And if you notice, the president's statement says ""in Africa."" It's not specific. It says he sought—it didn't say he received or he acquired. It's that he sought. And it cites the British document. <BR><BR>My only point is that, in retrospect, knowing that some of the documents underneath may have been—were, indeed, forgeries, and knowing that apparently there were concerns swirling around about this, had we known that at the time, we would not have put it in. Because we have a very high standard for the president's speeches. We don't put any intelligence—just an intelligence fact in the president's speech, just an intelligence report in the president's speech. We put in the president's speech things that the agencies will stand up and say, ""We have high confidence in that."" That's what we use the clearance process for. And had there been even a peep that the agency did not want that sentence in or that George Tenet did not want that sentence in, that the director of Central Intelligence did not want it in, it would have been gone. <BR><BR>Mr. Doyle McManus, <EM>The Los Angeles Times:</EM> Well, again . . . <BR><BR>Schieffer: Doyle. <BR><BR>Mr. McManus: . . . on—on Bob's question on how this got into the speech, a number of officials at CIA, at the State Department and elsewhere, have said, you know, in that period of time the White House was making its case against Saddam Hussein. It was trying to make the toughest prosecution case it could. And folks who had dissenting voices or uncertainty about this intelligence just felt ground down and worn out and a little bit hesitant to bring their dissents up in the process. Is that part of the problem? <BR><BR>Dr. Rice: These are intelligence professionals. And the president and the vice president and I and others always made clear to intelligence professionals and especially to the DCI that there was to be nothing but what the intelligence a—agencies wanted to tell us. The last thing that we need or want is to have an intelligence agency that's telling you what you want to hear. That's not how this president operates. And, in fact, if you look at the broad story here—again, we are talking about one line, one data point. Yes, s—the director said yesterday it was a mistake to have that one data point in, given what we know. But we are talking about a broad case of nuclear reconstitution that was a key judgment of the national intelligence agency—estimate which was what the president relies on, that had lots of data and lots of data points about what Saddam Hussein was trying to do to acquire nuclear weapon, that out of history of a man who was very close to acquiring a nuclear weapon in 1991. So this didn't come out of the blue somehow. <BR><BR>Mr. McManus: Well, let me ask about—about the broader case. Because in the same period you were saying, for example, that you had information that Saddam Hussein's forces had weapons of mass destruction ready to disburse to their troops to meet the American forces. Those weapons haven't turned up. You were saying and others were saying that—that you were quite confident of links between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda, and I think a lot of us expected after American forces got into Iraq, that they would begin finding the intelligence to support those contentions. And that was one of their mission. We haven't seen a lot of intelligence to—to back it up. Why shouldn't the ordinary citizen look at this picture and say, ""Boy, they were leaning awfully hard in one direction and this nuclear issue does look a little bit like a possible pattern where the goods just aren't there""? <BR><BR>Dr. Rice: Doyle, if you go to the question of what we knew when we went to war, that is a separable question from what we will now find in a disciplined press—disciplined process that will require us to look at thousands and thousands of documents, interview many, many scientists and to put together a picture of how Saddam Hussein was concealing his programs; what became of the unaccounted-for nuclear weapons, about which the U.N. talked in several reports, the unaccounted-for—unaccounted-for weapons of mass destruction, about which they talked; the reconstitution programs. We will have to put together a full picture of what happened. <BR><BR>But if you go back to what was there at the time, you go back not to 2003, you go back to 1991. You go back to the fact that he had weapons of mass destruction when he was defeated in the Gulf War, that the inspectors found in 1994, '95 that he had a completely clandestine biological weapons program, which he only revealed after his brother-in-law defected. We find that in 1998 and in 1999, UNSCOM, the U.N. agency, is saying there are large numbers of unaccounted-for weapons of mass destruction, biological and chemical, that he will not account for. We're talking about somebody who threw out inspectors in—in 1998. I mean, there's—President Clinton, who&nbsp;went to war against him in 1998 because of his weapons of mass destruction. <BR><BR>Mr. McManus: And that is—that is the record. <BR><BR>Dr. Rice: There's a very . . . <BR><BR>Mr. McManus: And that's . . . <BR><BR>Dr. Rice: . . . very big record here. <BR><BR>Schieffer: But nobody disputes that part of it. It's—we're talking about . . . <BR><BR>Dr. Rice: Well, that's exactly the point. <BR><BR>Schieffer: . . . in the months before we went to war. <BR><BR>Dr. Rice: But in the . . . <BR><BR>Schieffer: Everybody knows that he had weapons of mass destruction at one point. <BR><BR>Dr. Rice: And I don't think anybody would argue that, in the months before the war, he suddenly didn't have weapons of mass destruction that he had in 1998. It got better somehow between 1998 and 2003? As to the reports that we were dispersing to the field or the likes, yes, there were multiple reports from multiple sources, some of the sources very close, that he was restructuring his forces in a way that allowed chemical use at lower levels, that he had certain red lines that if they were crossed he might use chemical weapons, that he was dispersing equipment to his forces. And, indeed, we found 3,000 chemical suits and atropine injectors, which is an antidote to nerve agent. And the president and the secretary of defense, of course, had to prepare our troops for that eventuality. <BR><BR>I've been the subject of some stories that say, ""Well, you know, you should have connected the dots that 19 men were going to drive airplanes into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on September 11th."" I can tell you, very few dots for that; thousands of dots about Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction and the threat that they posed going back over three administrations, the first Bush administration, the Clinton administration. Sources from the British, from the Australians, from other European services, and his own record of concealment and what the U.N. had found. <BR><BR>Had the president of the United States not drawn the conclusion that this man, given his history and his propensity to attack his neighbors and to be a problem in this volatile region was not a problem for the United States, he would not have been doing his duty. And I think we have to remember why we went to war in Iraq. The president said to the American people after 9/11, ""We are going to have to fight the war on terrorism on the offense."" <BR><BR>My colleague Tom Ridge and colleague John Gordon do everything they can, every day, to try and defend and hearten the United States. But we all know, and the president said on September 20, 2001, ""We're going to have to take this battle to them."" And in removing Saddam Hussein, we have removed from this very volatile region a source of instability in a region that has got to change if it is not to remain a region that brings about ideologies of hatred, that cause people to slam . . . <BR><BR>Schieffer: But, Dr. Rice, if we . . . <BR><BR>Dr. Rice: . . . airplanes into American buildings. <BR><BR>Schieffer: If we could kind of get back to the subject at hand, did—did the vice president's office review this speech? Did they agree with this statement? <BR><BR>Dr. Rice: Well, of course the vice president's office reviewed the speech. The vice president reviewed the speech. <BR><BR>Schieffer: Wasn't it . . . <BR><BR>Dr. Rice: All of the principals reviewed the speech. That's the purpose of sending it to them. <BR><BR>Schieffer: Did—did your staff insist that this be put into the speech? Is that how it got there? <BR><BR>Dr. Rice: Bob, there's no question of insistence. What happens is that a lot of data about Saddam Hussein and his massive programs and his efforts to acquire various kinds of weapons of mass destruction are compiled from a lot of sources: from the national intelligence estimate, from—from declassified sources, from unclassified sources, from the British White Paper. A text is created. That text is then sent out to everybody for review. And the question that is asked of the agencies is: Do you stand by, for the president, not the accuracy of this . . . <BR><BR>Schieffer: But is there . . . <BR><BR>Dr. Rice: . . . for somebody else, but for the president? <BR><BR>Schieffer: Then is it all right for you to you say it but not for the president to say it? <BR><BR>Dr. Rice: Well, no. <BR><BR>Schieffer: Are there two levels here? <BR><BR>Dr. Rice: No, for the president, though, we do have a very high standard which is that it is the most solid evidence, that people have confidence in it, and that what the president is telling the American people particularly . . . <BR><BR>Schieffer: OK. <BR><BR>Dr. Rice: . . . the—the American people in the State of the Union is . . . <BR><BR>Schieffer: You—I'm going to ask you . . . <BR><BR>Dr. Rice: . . . absolutely solid. And I just want to say, Bob, because it's—there's been a lot of misreporting about this. We've never said that the British report was wrong. And I've seen many stories about how this was inaccurate or incorrect and we knew that. The British still stand by this report. They stand by it because they have sources that we did not have, and we would not put something in the president's speech that we couldn't look at all the sourcing. <BR><BR>Schieffer: Do you—do you st . . . <BR><BR>Dr. Rice: That's why the agency says now that it should not have been in the speech. <BR><BR>Schieffer: Do you still stand by what you said last month and that is that—you said in—in June, I believe it was, on two television shows that the intelligence community did not know there were serious questions about this—about this report? <BR><BR>Dr. Rice: Well, the intelligence . . . <BR><BR>Schieffer: Is that still accurate? <BR><BR>Dr. Rice: About the British report? <BR><BR>Schieffer: No, just about—that you said that there are intelligence agencies at that time didn't know. <BR><BR>Dr. Rice: What I knew at the time is that no one had told us that there were concerns about the British reporting. Apparently, there were. They were apparently committed—communicated to the British. The British said, ""We have other sources,"" and we now know that. I have to assume that in our clearance process, if there are concerns about something that the president is going to say, that they will be communicated to us. <BR><BR>Schieffer: Is Tenet going to resign? There are reports today that he is considering that. <BR><BR>Dr. Rice: The president said yesterday when he was in Nigeria that he has confidence in George Tenet, he has confidence in the men and women of the CIA and that we've all got a lot of work to do. A mistake—this was a mistake, right? The clearance process should have picked up that this did not rise to the very high level—even if it was accurate which it—it was, that it was not something that the agency, when asked, would say, ""Oh, yes, we have confidence in that."" And that's the standard. Do you have confidence in this for the president of the United States to say it? It was a mistake about a single sentence, a single data point, and I frankly think it has been overblown. George Tenet is serving the president very well. <BR><BR>Mr. McManus: Well, in view of not only that mistake but the accounts from other officials that they didn't have confidence in other parts of the intelligence process, should there be a broader investigation and a tougher investigation of how good the information was? <BR><BR>Dr. Rice: Well, I don't know what you're referring to, Doyle. The national intelligence estimate has key judgments in it, key judgments on—about reconstitution, key judgments about his possession of biological and chemical weapons, key judgments about his efforts to conceal. And those judgments are a coordinated product of the intelligence community. And, yes, there were dissents of some intelligence agencies. INR [State Department Bureau of Intelligence and Research], for instance, dissented to certain portions of this . . . <BR><BR>Schieffer: The State Department intelligence office. <BR><BR>Dr. Rice: . . . the State Department intelligence. But there is a coordinated product. It's a disciplined process and that's why there's a disciplined process. And so even if there are dissents out there, the president relies on the disciplined process that the director of Central Intelligence wants. <BR><BR>Mr. McManus: So no need for a—a tougher investigation? <BR><BR>Dr. Rice: I—my own view is the—the cognizant intelligence committees are looking at this, they're looking at the whole range, as well we should now, of what was known before we went to war and how we knew it. That is perfectly logical, but we have to keep this in the context of 12 years, three administrations, multiple sources and a bloody dictator who was known to have had weapons of mass destruction, known to have used them and, therefore, a threat that the president of the United States decided to take care of. <BR><BR>Schieffer: Dr. Rice, some very tough questions this morning.

I want you to take a look at it. <BR><BR>(previously taped segment) <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: The area in the south and the west and the north that coalition forces control is substantial. It happens not to be the area where weapons of mass destruction were dispersed. We know where they are. They are in the area around Tikrit and Baghdad and east, west, south, and north somewhat. (end of taped segment) </P>  <P>Stephanopoulos: You said, ""We know where they are."" Have those sites where you thought the weapons of mass destruction were—have those been inspected now? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: I probably should have said we know where they were instead of we know where they are. At that moment, the intelligence community said these are ""x"" number of suspect sites, meaning we have reason to believe that they might be in these various locations—numbers of hundreds— <BR><BR>Stephanopoulos: —but at that time, on March 30th, you believed the weapons were there? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: Exactly. We did believe that, and they may have been there. We've been out looking at those sites, and—some of those sites—and have gone through some fraction of them. It takes a long time. It's an enormously big country and, as you'll recall, the one individual came in and took the investigators into his backyard near a rosebush, dug down, and found things that had been buried there for years with respect to the Iraqi nuclear program, and you can imagine—how would anyone have known that except for the person who buried them coming in and saying, ""Here they are."" So what the Iraqi survey group is now doing is they are, instead of running around to all these suspect sites that we had, where we believed they were, they are instead going through the interrogation process with these people and trying to find people who can tell us where they are. <BR><BR>Stephanopoulos: So just on that they haven't looked at every one of those sites yet? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: No, they have not. <BR><BR>Stephanopoulos: But, so far, they have found no weapons? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: I wouldn't say that. <BR><BR>Stephanopoulos: You wouldn't say that? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: No. <BR><BR>Stephanopoulos: They've found weapons? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: They have found things—they have not found things that when one aggregates them and looks at them that they would say, ""Aha, there it is,"" but they are finding things, and then what they do is, they take the materials, and they send them to several different laboratories to be tested. Then it comes back, and it's not what you thought it might be. They send some more out, and it comes back, and it's a dual use. It could be this or it could be that—something civilian or something military, and that process just—we just have to be patient. It's been 10 weeks now. We've got a wonderful team of people working on the problems. They are intelligent, they are serious, they are purposeful, and they are going to keep looking, and there isn't anyone who has looked at all the intelligence, that I know of, who doesn't believe that the intelligence community was correct. <BR><BR>Stephanopoulos: But you say that they may have been there on March 30th. <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: They can be moved. <BR><BR>Stephanopoulos: You think they could have been moved? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: Of course, they can be moved. <BR><BR>Stephanopoulos: Well, if that's true— <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: —<SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>we know they had mobile capabilities, and think of the lethality of biological or chemical weapons and what a relatively small amount can be easily moved and buried—or transported somewhere.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Stephanopoulos: If that's true, couldn't the war then, the military operation, have invoked your worst fear—that these weapons would be moved and get in the hands of terrorists? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>They could have, and they still could, which is the reason you need to find them.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Stephanopoulos: So you believe that weapons could have been, say, taken out of the country and sold to Al Qaeda? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>I'm not going to say that. I think they could have been moved. They could have been moved within the country or somewhere else but, basically, we don't know, and we intend to find out, and I believe we will find out.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Stephanopoulos: Does that show a failure, then, of the Defense Department, and it was your responsibility to secure the sites or failure to secure those sites? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: No, I mean, how can you secure a site that's—sites in a country the size of California that has open borders, porous borders, people moving in and out? Even today, people move in and out. It's not possible to secure every single site, and what one has to do is go in and win the war, throw out the regime, and then as rapidly as possible, shift that fighting force into a presence force and try to provide security in the country. Think of all the things that—the bad things that didn't happen. There was not a big humanitarian crisis; there was not enormous—tens of thousands—of refugees fleeing the country; there was not enormous destruction to the infrastructure; the dams were not broken and flooding the people; the weapons of mass destruction were not used, even though they had chemical weapons suits we found in Southern Iraq ready to be used. <BR><BR>Stephanopoulos: But can you be certain that they had these weapons ready to be used. You're not certain of that. <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: I didn't say that. I said we found the suits that an Iraqi would wear, were they going to use those weapons or deal in that kind of a conflict. We had ours, as well. Our people were all equipped with those kinds of protected devices. They had to be, because we were convinced and remain convinced, that they had that capability. We know this from 12 years—the U.N. has said so; the defectors have said so; all the intelligence community; the debate in the U.N. wasn't whether they had chemical/biological or a nuclear—we never said they had a nuclear weapon—we said they had a nuclear program. That was never any debate. The debate was—how long should you wait after they violate 17 U.N. resolutions before you enforce those resolutions?</P>",True,"Iraq, WMD, chemical, biological, nuclear, Al Qaeda, FS","Saddam Hussein, George W.

And in the assessment if there are disagreements between different intelligence communities they say so. So they say five out of the six elements believe this is a fact and this one element thinks that there isn't enough evidence to support that assessment. A month later a new piece of information, and there isn't a month that goes by that someone in an intelligence brief does not come into me and say you remember what the assessment was here, we have a new piece of information and were changing that. It changes everyday, every week, every month, and now does that surprise you? No. And that is the way our lives are. Everything—all the things we learn and know, constantly keep changing because the world is not static, and because we are dealing with closed communities, closed societies. So intelligence is important, it's a tough business; we [sic] got very fine people doing it. George Tenet is a terrific public servant, and the president was correct, and that George Tenet corrects those 12, 16, 18, 20 words, should not have been in that speech.

1075,2003-07-13,"Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, Interview with NBC's <EM>Meet The Press</EM>","Russert: Vice President Cheney did say on this program they have reconstituted their nuclear weapons. Whether he misspoke or not, I will ask him next time he's here. But he did make that phrase. Only one time on the program he said it. Five other times he said ""program"" — <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: I'm sure he meant— <BR><BR>Russert: One time he said ""weapons."" <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: I'm sure he meant programs. <BR><BR>Russert: Let me turn to the whole idea of and issue of weapons of mass destruction. George Will, conservative commentator who supported the war, wrote this column, and let me read it to you and our viewers, because it's very important: ""Some say the war was justified even if weapons of mass destruction are not found nor their destruction explained, because the world is better off without Saddam Hussein. Of course it is better off. But unless one is prepared to postulate a U.S. right, perhaps even a duty, to militarily dismantle any tyranny, it is unacceptable to argue that Hussein's mass graves and torture chambers suffice as retrospective justifications for preemptive war. Americans seem sanguine about the failure—so far—to validate the war's premise about the threat posed by Hussein's weapons of mass destruction. But a long-term failure would unravel much of this president's policy and rhetoric."" If we don't find the weapons of mass destruction, will the president, will our country's credibility, be hurt severely? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>I think we will find them. And why do I say that? I say that because I have got confidence in our intelligence community and the intelligence communities in other countries.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Russert: In March you did say, quote, ""We know where they are."" <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: The phrase was almost always ""suspect sites."" And the next day one would have to say where they were, not where they are, because things are movable. And when you can take a relatively small amount of very lethal chemical or biological weapons, or capability, and move it in an hour, and I mean think of the person who went out under their rose bush in the back yard of their private home and dug up things that he had been told to bury there a decade— <BR><BR>Russert: But if we don't find— <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: Just a minute, Tim. <BR><BR>Russert: But if we don't find them. <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>I say we will.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Russert: You will? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>I think so.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Russert: Absolutely? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>I believe—I don't say absolutely.

1079,2003-07-16,White House Press Briefing by Scott McClellan,"<P>Question: Let me just follow up on one other thing, hang on a second. You repeated something this morning that the president is fond of saying, and that is, when speaking to critics of both the war and the occupation, you said that they're focused on elections and possibly even revising history or rewriting history. What is it that they're revising or rewriting? What are you referring to? <BR><BR>Mr. McClellan: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Well, the case against Saddam Hussein and his regime was solid and compelling. There was never any discussion about whether or not Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction or weapons of mass destruction program until recently. That's only recently come into play.</SPAN> </P>  <P><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>The debate was about how to confront these weapons of mass destruction. It was about how to confront a regime that was willing to use these weapons of mass destruction.</SPAN> And you do have to raise the question about certain members of Congress now who are trying to rewrite history. They're trying to revise history. </P>  <P>The last thing anyone should do is politicize this issue by rewriting history. There are some where the present rhetoric does not match their past record. So look back at past comments. Look back at past voting records. Congress overwhelmingly, in a bipartisan way, passed a resolution supporting the steps that we are taking and approving the use of force if it was necessary, after 12 years of Saddam Hussein's deception and denial to confront that threat. </P>  <P>But let me point out a couple of comments—these are from 1998. In a letter to President Clinton, one member of Congress talked about—well, talked about the president —he urged the president to ""take necessary actions to respond effectively to the threat posed by Iraq's refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs. By its refusal to abandon its quest for weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them, Iraq is directly defying and challenging the international community and directly violating the terms of the cease-fire between itself and the United States-led coalition."" That was Senator [Carl] Levin, back in 1998, well before the attacks of September 11th, which brought to light the new threats of the 21st century. </P>  <P>Let me read one more and then we'll move on. ""Saddam Hussein has already used these weapons and has made it clear that he has the intent to continue to try, by virtue of his duplicity and secrecy, to continue to do so. That is a threat to the stability of the Middle East. It is a threat with respect to the potential of terrorist activities on a global basis."" Again, this was in 1998, and that was by Senator [John] Kerry. </P>  <P>One other comment. ""If we do nothing, I promise you we will face this issue one way or the other again in the Gulf or with respect to Israel or in some form, and I think it is absolutely vital for us to recognize the enormous principle with respect to proliferation and the challenge that this represents in the long term for our country. If we don't face this today, we will face it at some point down the road."" This was 1998 and that was Senator Kerry. <BR><BR>Question: Do you think that—the truth is there are facts on the ground right now that—you can go back to statements from 1998 and such, but there are facts on the ground now that are raising questions about the situation as presented or laid out by the president, what we could expect, what you all believed would happen, what you believed you would find. Now we have facts on the ground that are undermining the quality and the credibility of those comments. <BR><BR>Mr. McClellan: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>I differ. I think we're beginning to learn the truth and we've seen some of the evidence of Saddam Hussein's desire to seek nuclear weapons, going back quite a while. We've seen some of the evidence of his weapons of mass destruction program through two mobile biological weapon labs that have been discovered.</SPAN> And that's in—we've only been there, what, 120 days. <BR><BR>Question: Well, do you think, though, that you have a credibility problem right now? <BR><BR>Mr. McClellan: I think that you need to look back at some of the comments that are being made by some in Congress, and ask them— <BR><BR>Question: Well, they might have their own credibility problems, but I'm asking about you. Does the White House have a credibility problem now? <BR><BR>Mr. McClellan: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Absolutely not. The president has been very straightforward about this from the beginning. He laid out a very compelling case, a very clear case. It was based on solid evidence and it was based on a number of factors. It was based on Saddam Hussein's past history of not only having chemical and biological weapons, but being willing to use those chemical and biological weapons. It was based on UNSCOM's [United Nations Special Commission] report from 1999, it's [sic] final report to the United Nations Security Council, saying he has large stockpiles of unaccounted for biological and chemical weapons. It was based on his support for terrorists and his support for—and his harboring of terrorists. So there are a number of compelling parts of this evidence that led to us confronting this threat. And the last thing the president wanted to do was go to war. But Saddam Hussein, for 12 years, was defying the international community, he was defying the United Nations and 17 resolutions. The United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441, that final resolution made it very clear, this is a final opportunity to comply, final opportunity to disarm.</SPAN> And not only is America safer, the region is safer and the Iraqi people free, but the Middle East will be more peaceful and more stable because of the action that we have taken.</P>",True,"Iraq, WMD, chemical, biological, nuclear, FS","Saddam Hussein, George W.

Because it was a senior deputy of the national security adviser who was in discussions with the CIA about some way to get the uranium evidence into the State of the Union, should the buck not stop with the national security adviser, as opposed to the CIA director? <BR><BR>Mr. McClellan: John, I think we've been through this. When you're talking about intelligence, the CIA is our lead intelligence agency. They were involved in the clearance process.

Does the NSC [National Security Council] bear no culpability whatsoever in this matter? <BR><BR>Mr. McClellan: John, there are a lot of people that are involved in the vetting process.

At the start of the briefing they released to the press the Key Judgments and the Niger paragraphs from the NIE [national intelligence estimate], both of which we had declassified that morning. Their intent was obvious: they wanted to demonstrate that the intelligence community had given the administration and Congress every reason to believe that Saddam had a robust WMD program that was growing in seriousness every day. <BR><BR>The briefers were questioned about press accounts saying that the White House had taken references to Niger out of the Cincinnati speech at CIA's request. Why then, did they insert them again in the State of the Union? The senior officials said that the material that was taken out of the first speech was quite different from the material the president used before Congress. That simply wasn't so.

I really don't think this is motivating them. <BR><BR>To the extent that they believe that Mr. Blair and President Bush have been weakened in some way, I think that gives them—you know, that's certainly something they would welcome, but they're deceiving themselves if they welcomed it very long because I think this will all pass in due course. <BR><BR>People will see that what President Bush and Prime Minister Blair and the other members of the coalition did was right.

Information comes along, you take the information and try to assess its validity, and you convert it into a piece of intelligence. Sometimes it comes with lots of qualifiers on it, and it is up to policymakers to make judgments as to whether you can—that intelligence is something you can make a policy decision about. <BR><BR>I have been through it many times where something looked very good at a particular point in time and looked better over time or looked worse over time, as more information came in. With respect to the State of the Union Address, they were looking for things that could make the case to the American people. This was an item that was in the intelligence world. It was referred to in NIEs [national intelligence estimates] and other documents, and it went into the State of the Union Address. <BR><BR>On reflection, did it meet the standard that might have been appropriate for a State of the Union Address? You have heard the judgments that have been rendered on that. But by the time I was prepared and ready to go up and present it to the world, I had to make sure that there wasn't any more questioning of what I was going to put forward because I had a heck of an audience. <BR><BR>The audience I was most worried about was not the audience in the Security Council. It wasn't even the massive television audience waiting for the Adlai Stevenson moment. It was the Iraqis who, if they knew more than me, could shoot down anything I said if I didn't have it right. I wasn't worried about you guys. I was worried about the Iraqis showing up that afternoon or the next morning with something that would shoot down something I said. <BR><BR>So that is why mine was done in the way that it was done. The only thing anybody came up with was the Iraqis, of course, said it's all lies. The only challenge was debate about the centrifuges, which I acknowledged at the time I presented it. There was a debate. <BR><BR>Then a couple of days later, a week or so later, there was some question about one of the overheads I used of a bunker complex, as to whether everybody agreed with my characterization of what made a particular bunker look like a chemical weapons storage bunker.

As Prime Minister Blair said last week, the British government still stands by this statement and the intelligence on which it was based. </P>  <P>And the president had every reason to believe that the text of the State of the Union presented to him was sound. But the fact is that given the October 5 and 6 CIA memorandum, and my telephone conversation with the DCI [director of Central Intelligence George] Tenet at roughly the some time, I should have recalled at the time of the State of the Union speech that there was controversy associated with the uranium issue. </P>  <P>When the language in the drafts of the State of the Union referred to efforts to acquire natural uranium, I should have either asked that they—the 16 words given to that subject be stricken, or I should have alerted DCI Tenet.

1088,2003-07-23,"Secretary of State Colin Powell, Interview With Lebanese Broadcast Corporation","Secretary Powell: No, it's wrong. It's a wrong question. The president's vision is being implemented in Iraq today and the president's vision reflects the advice that he has received from both the Pentagon and State Department. The Pentagon and the State Department have been working very, very closely over the last eight months on this issue. I'm the one who went and presented the intelligence case to the United Nations on the 5th of February. <BR><BR>And so surely there will always be some differences of perspective from the diplomatic side and from the military side, but what we are all doing is executing the president's vision and his decisions. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>And what you've seen is that a very terrible regime that was responsible for the death of tens upon tens of thousands of Muslims has been removed from power, no longer have weapons of mass destruction.</SPAN> I think the Arab world should look carefully at all of these graves that are now being opened up, mass graves filled with the bodies of people, Muslims, who were killed, not by the United States and not by the United Kingdom, but by Saddam Hussein and his sons and that regime—and it's gone. <BR><BR>Question: I don't think anyone would argue the fact it was a terrible regime. We've seen all the evidence about it. But the war was fought on a different premise, on weapons of mass destruction being found. Now, with so many weeks and months having gone by without weapons of mass destruction being found, Saddam's still on the loose, rising toll of U.S. casualties, what situation does that put the U.S. in? Does that put you vis-a-vis the Europeans, who did not want this war to take place, in a position of we told you so? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: Some Europeans did not believe the war was appropriate. Most Europeans did believe it was an appropriate war and most Europeans did support the action of the coalition. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>With respect to weapons of mass destruction, I am confident that as we develop information, as more informants come forward, informants of the kind that helped us find the two sons of Saddam Hussein, the evidence will be there for the world to see. The world agreed that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. The world passed resolution after resolution in the Security Council saying that he had weapons of mass destruction and he had to do something about it, had to account for them, get rid of them, destroy them, and they didn't do it. And therefore I believe that the coalition was fully justified under U.N. Resolution 1441, which starts out with an indictment of the regime, we were fully justified in taking the action that was taken.</SPAN> <BR><BR>And one can debate the premise, one can argue about facts, one can argue about intelligence information and one can argue about perceived differences between the various departments of the U.S. Government, but the reality of the world today, on this day, is that this regime is gone, the people of Iraq are now looking to a better life. They are going to have an economy that functions, they're going to be respected on the world stage. And I think that is what we ought to be looking at. <BR><BR>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Question: And if you please, Mr. Secretary, in recent days, there has been a bit of stepped-up rhetoric from this administration towards Syria and Iran. Do you think that this administration can convince the world about—to the issue of weapons of mass destruction, the threats of them, or lack thereof, in the light of its inability to present the evidence in the case on Iraq? <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>The evidence of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction has been seen by the world for 14 years. Do not, do not suggest to your audience that Iraq did not have or has never had weapons of mass destruction. The evidence is there, and we have seen it.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Question: We just haven't found the weapons. <BR><BR>Secretary Powell: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Yes, we have. We have pictures of all through the '90s, of weapons of mass destruction that they had. We had them throwing out the inspectors, making sure the inspectors had to leave. And I think the case I presented on the 5th of February, has yet to be undercut by what we have—what we have seen.</SPAN> <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Now, we have people searching all over Iraq now. And I am quite confident that when they finish their work, when they finish their report, there will be no question about it.</SPAN> But it should not be—no impression should be left that somehow Iraq was innocent of possession of weapons of mass destruction being used against their own people and against the Iranians. <BR><BR>Now, with respect to Iran and Syria, the rhetoric hasn't been changed significantly. We have said to both of them that if they want to have a better relationship with the United States, and if they, frankly, want to contribute to the process of peace that is underway in the region, then they have to stop supporting terrorist organizations. They have to stop providing the wherewithal to Hezbollah to conduct terrorist acts. <BR><BR>And we also believe both of those nations should foreswear, not get involved in the development of weapons of mass destruction, on the Iranian side especially, programs that would lead to the development of a nuclear weapon. I don't think these are unreasonable demands to place on both Syria and Iran. <BR><BR>Do they want to see peace in the region?

You were quoted, famously in <EM>Vanity Fair</EM> magazine as saying the truth is that for reasons that have a lot to do with the U.S. Government bureaucracy we settled on the one issue that everyone could agree on which was weapons of mass destruction as the core reason. It sounded cynical. </P>  <P>Paul Wolfowitz: Not cynical at all. I said there are three reasons, I mentioned the other two, we can go into them later, let's stay on this main one. It's not my opinion. It's been the unanimous opinion of the intelligence community for many years going way back into the last administration, there are quotes from President Clinton on this issue that sound exactly like President Bush. </P>  <P>You know, Baghdad is a city, I believe, an area something like ten times Washington D.C., I think it's comparable to Los Angeles. As we were flying over looking at thousands of houses and thinking, any one of those could have enough anthrax in the basement to kill a whole city, we're not going to find it by house-to-house searches. We're only going to find it by painstakingly getting people to talk to us and that's going to take time. I would hope the fate of Uday [Hussein] and Qusay [Hussein] might encourage people to talk a little more. But it's going to take time. </P>  <P>Gwen Ifill: You're still counting on human intelligence on the ground? </P>  <P>Paul Wolfowitz: It's the only way. </P>  <P>Gwen Ifill: And point the direction to where these weapons might be? </P>  <P>Paul Wolfowitz: It's really the only way it will work. </P>  <P>Gwen Ifill: Is that something that the U.N. inspectors could have done? </P>  <P>Paul Wolfowitz: They could have done more of it than they did do, but it's a hard job, it would have been a very hard job for them also. </P>  <P>Gwen Ifill: As we talk about intelligence, as you know, certainly this happened before you left and while you were gone, there's been much discussion about the role that intelligence played in supporting our decision, the U.S. decision to go to war, a big drama in Britain as well as here. How important do you think pre-war intelligence was and how useful and accurate do you think it was in providing the underpinnings for the argument to go to war in Iraq? </P>  <P>Paul Wolfowitz: I think Prime Minister Blair said it with an eloquence that I can't reproduce, but I can try to paraphrase it when he spoke to the joint session of Congress, and he said that if it were to turn out that they didn't have weapons of mass destruction, what we've done for the people of Iraq in building a free and democratic Iraq would have been worth it in itself. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>But he said, and I agree with him on this, that he remains deeply convinced that this regime had those weapons, that this regime was a threat to the whole region and to the rest of the world, and that that threat has gone away.</SPAN> </P>  <P>Gwen Ifill: If there was a strong humanitarian argument to be made about the atrocities being committed in Iraq as a reason to go to war, why wasn't that the core reason? </P>  <P>Paul Wolfowitz: Well, I think putting young American lives at risk is something that I believe, and I think the president believes, you do to preserve the security of this country. But if you're looking at the issue of was this war moral or immoral, was it a war against Iraq or for Iraq, there's no question it was moral. There's no question it was for Iraq. The only question is whether it advanced America's security. </P>  <P>And I'm absolutely convinced that it did advance America's security because that whole part of the world which has been a breeding ground for terrorists now for over a decade will be less of a breeding ground when we succeed, and we will succeed in helping the Iraqi people build a better country. </P>  <P>Gwen Ifill: There has also been quite a substantial debate going on about the source of a claim in the president's State of the Union speech about uranium buys from Iraq, from Niger. Did the Department of Defense have a hand in any of that? By now we've heard that the head of the CIA say it was my fault, the deputy national security adviser say it was my fault, did this ever pass through the Department of Defense? </P>  <P>Paul Wolfowitz: We're in the lucky position in the end, we'll say that particular one never went by us but, at least to the best of my knowledge. But look — <BR><BR>Gwen Ifill: Do you believe it to be true? </P>  <P>Paul Wolfowitz: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>I think that everybody is focused on a very tiny minor issue. If you look at the intelligence assessments about chemical, biological, nuclear weapons, and personally I always believed the chemical and biological were much more dangerous because the assessments were they have them now, not that they're just working on them, there was never any basic doubt that this was a man who was consumed with acquiring those capabilities, and just look, for twelve years, he sacrificed an enormous amount of money, which means to him enormous numbers of palaces, enormous numbers of Mercedes Benz, tanks, artillery, all kinds of, terrorists, all the things he liked to buy with his money, he gave them up in order not to have to give up his chemical, biological, nuclear programs.

1096,2003-07-27,"Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, Interview on NBC's <EM>Meet The Press</EM>","<P>Tim Russert: Let me turn to the rationale for the war. You gave an interview in <EM>Vanity Fair</EM> magazine, and the Pentagon released the full transcript of your remarks, which we're going to use, because they are your words, and let me share them with our viewers: ""The truth is that for reasons that have a lot to do with the U.S. government bureaucracy, we settled on one issue that everyone could agree on, which was weapons of mass destruction as the core reason for the war in Iraq, if you will. But there have always been three fundamental concerns, one is weapons of mass destruction, the second is support for terrorism, the third is the criminal treatment of the Iraqi people. The third one by itself, as I think I said earlier, is a reason to help the Iraqis, but it's not a reason to put American kids' lives at risk, certainly not on the scale we did. The second issue about links to terrorism is one about which there is the most disagreement within the bureaucracy."" </P>  <P>Just analyze your comments, one, weapons of mass destruction. Thus far, we have not found weapons of mass destruction. Two, in terms of support of terrorism, as you acknowledge there is broad disagreement within our intelligence community about that and whether there's any direct link of Saddam to Al Qaeda. And the third, as you said, Saddam's treatment of his people is not a reason to go to war. </P>  <P>So, if you don't have weapons of mass destruction, and you don't have a direct link to terrorism, and you do have the third, which the administration has been emphasizing, but you yourself said it's not a rationale to go to war. What now is the rationale for having gone to war? <BR><BR>Wolfowitz: Okay, let me have as much time to answer as you took to ask the question. It's important. I appreciate it. </P>  <P>And, by the way, you know, you go to war based on your best assessment before the war. You will, especially with a country like Iraq, you will learn things afterwards that may be different. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>But, first of all, the fundamental thing I was saying, and I wish people would pay attention to it, was there was no disagreement before the fact whatsoever on weapons of mass destruction. It was unanimous. And, frankly, the Senate and House Armed Services Committee, the Senate and House Intelligence Committees, had access to all the intelligence that people are now debating.</SPAN> </P>  <P>Russert: But, not on nuclear, it was not unanimous? <BR><BR>Wolfowitz: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>It was unanimous that there was a program, there was disagreement about how far along it was, or how long it would take him to get there. Okay. That's point number one.</SPAN> </P>  <P>Russert: This is important, because this is what the State Department said, and this is from the national intelligence estimate that the White House declassified and released. This is what they said: ""The activities we've detected do not add up to a compelling case that Iraq is currently pursuing what the State Department Bureau of Intelligence Research would consider to be an integrated and comprehensive approach to acquire nuclear weapons."" <BR><BR>Wolfowitz: I don't have the text in front of me, Tim, but <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>everyone including the State Department, look at those qualifiers, comprehensive, integrated, everyone agreed there was a program of some stage, and that it would become comprehensive, integrated, and real the minute he got rid of inspectors.</SPAN> There was no disagreement in the government about that. The nature of terrorism intelligence is intrinsically murky. And while I haven't had a chance to read the 900-page report that was released last week, my understanding from what has been said about it is that the basic conclusion there is that we should have connected the dots, we should have seen in this murky picture of terrorism intelligence what was coming to hit us. Well, if you wait until the terrorism picture is clear you're going to wait until after something terrible has happened. And we went to war, and I believe we are still fighting terrorists and terrorist supporters in Iraq, in a battle that will make this country safer in the future from terrorism. It is, as I said, I think winning the peace in Iraq is now the crucial battle in the war on terrorism, and the sacrifices that our magnificent troops are making is for their children, and their grandchildren, for our children and our grandchildren, and it is for our security.</P>",True,"Iraq, WMD, uranium, nuclear, Al Qaeda, FS","Saddam Hussein, George W.

Have you found any evidence, any new evidence, since he was toppled that there are connections? <BR><BR>Wolfowitz: Well, we talked about evidence before including Secretary Powell in his presentation to the United Nations. One of the things that, if I could give two impressions from Baghdad that are really, to me, very compelling in understanding how hard it is to break this veil of secrecy, the regime surrounded everything with, first of all, the sheer size of the place. You fly over Baghdad, I don't know my geography perfectly, I'm told it's the size of Los Angeles. It is just huge. You look at house after house after house. You say, every one of those houses is big enough to have a huge lethal quantity of anthrax in the basement. You're not going to find it by house-to-house searches. You're only going to find it when people talk. <BR><BR>An illustration of that, we visited the police academy because some terrific training is going on to build a new police force, the leadership of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was there a couple of weeks ago, and they admired the training of the police force, as did I. What they didn't know, but was discovered a couple of days before I got there was that they had subsequently discovered that behind the police academy was a torture chamber where this woman who was reported in the press last week as having been tied to a tree and they did unspeakable things to her, right behind Uday's [Hussein's] compound. That was sitting there behind the police academy, and the police and the police academy didn't know about it until this woman came in and told them what happened. We're going to be unveiling secrets in Iraq day after day after day. <BR><BR>Schieffer: But have you found at this point any new connections to Al Qaeda that you didn't know about? <BR><BR>Wolfowitz: Bob, this is in the very capable hands of the CIA led out there by David Kaye [sic], and assisted by Keith— <BR><BR>Schieffer: But you'd know if we had, would you not? <BR><BR>Wolfowitz: Well, first of all, I wouldn't necessarily.

These things need to be checked carefully. <BR><BR>Schieffer: But you know, obviously the reason I'm asking this is because this is one of the justifications. And, as you well know, the line your critics are taking is that you went after Saddam Hussein because you couldn't find Osama bin Laden. How do you respond to that? <BR><BR>Wolfowitz: Well, look, if you go back to October, George Tenet's classified testimony to the intelligence committees details what we thought we knew and what we didn't know about the links to terrorism. His public letter, which was published in the <EM>New York Times</EM>, talks about a number of known links to Al Qaeda. Is this a murky picture? Yes, it's murky. Information about terrorism is inevitably murky because terrorists hide, and because you get an awful lot of information that's simply not true. But, stop and think about what the 9/11 report is saying, it's saying that we should have connected these murky dots ahead of time. Well, you can't have it both ways. If you wait until you have absolute certainty about terrorism, you're really saying, we'll wait until after the fact and deal with it.

1099,2003-07-30,"National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, Interview on PBS's <EM>NewsHour with Jim Lehrer</EM>","Gwen Ifill: The president's defense of National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice today came at a critical time. A week ago, her chief deputy, Stephen Hadley, acknowledged he had been warned by the CIA in two separate memos that the agency would not stand by information suggesting Iraq was trying to buy uranium in Africa to reconstitute a nuclear weapons program. <BR><BR>That claim made it into the president's State of the Union speech and CIA Director George Tenet took the blame. But with Hadley's admission, new questions emerged. If he knew about the error in advance, who else did? Was it overlooked simply because the administration was anxious to bolster the case for war? <BR><BR>Here to answer these and other questions is National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice. Welcome, Dr. Rice. <BR><BR>Condoleezza Rice, National Security Adviser: Thank you. Nice to be with you. <BR><BR>Gwen Ifill: So the first question becomes the one I just posed. Did you know, or should you have known, that the information that went into the president's State of the Union speech regarding the purchase, or the efforts to purchase uranium in Niger or from Africa, another country in Africa, did you know that that information was not correct? <BR><BR>Condoleezza Rice: When the line was put into the president's State of the Union address and cleared by the Central Intelligence Agency, when I read the line I thought it was completely credible and that in fact it was backed by the agency. <BR><BR>What happened here is that we are really talking about two different processes. The State of the Union was put together, the speech went out for clearance, but the speech that the president had given in Cincinnati in October had also been sent out for clearance. <BR><BR>Gwen Ifill: That's the speech where he made— <BR><BR>Condoleezza Rice: This is the speech where he— <BR><BR>Gwen Ifill: —made the case for war. <BR><BR>Condoleezza Rice: Well, this is one of the speeches in which he made the case for war. And in that speech, a line had been there about the uranium issue and Saddam Hussein seeking uranium in Africa. And Director Tenet had called Steve Hadley and he told him, in no specifics, he told him I don't think you should put that in the president's speech because we don't want to make the president his own fact witness. Both Steve and Director Tenet remember the conversation in that way. <BR><BR>What we learned later, and I did not know at the time, and certainly did not know until just before Steve Hadley went out to say what he said last week, was that the director had also sent over to the White House a set of clearance comments that explained why he wanted this out of the speech. <BR><BR>I can tell you, I either didn't see the memo, I don't remember seeing the memo, the fact is it was a set of clearance comments, it was three and a half months before the State of the Union. And we're going to try to have a process now in which we don't have to depend on people's memories to link what was taken out of the speech in Cincinnati with what was put into the speech at the State of the Union. <BR><BR>Gwen Ifill: Should you have seen the memo? <BR><BR>Condoleezza Rice: Well, the memo came over. It was a clearance memo. It had a set of comments about the speech. It had already been taken out of the speech, from my point of view and from the point of view of Steve Hadley. Steve Hadley runs the clearance process. And when Director Tenet says something—takes something out of a speech, we take it out. We don't really even ask for an explanation. If the DCI, the director of Central Intelligence, is not going to stand by something, if he doesn't think that he has confidence in it, we're not going to put that into a presidential speech. We have no desire to have the president use information that is anything but the information in which we have the best confidence, the greatest confidence. <BR><BR>And so when Director Tenet said take it out of the speech, I think people simply took it out of the speech and didn't think any more about why we had taken it out of the speech. <BR><BR>Gwen Ifill: Do you feel any personal failure or responsibility for not having seen this memo and flagged it to anybody else who was working on this speech? <BR><BR>Condoleezza Rice: Well, I certainly feel personal responsibility for this entire episode. The president of the United States has every right to believe that what he is saying in his speeches is of the highest confidence of his staff. That's why we go through a clearance process. That's why the process is so rigorous. In this one case, the process did not work. We did have a clearance from the agency, but frankly, looking back, perhaps we should have remembered that it was taken out of the Cincinnati speech. We simply didn't. And what I've assured the president, and what I want to assure myself, is that our future processes will be ones in which we double-check to make sure that something has not been taken out of a speech, in which perhaps we get an affirmative answer from the principals that they in fact will stand behind an element of a speech as important as the State of the Union. <BR><BR>But what I feel, really, most responsible for is that this has detracted from the very strong case that the president has been making. There are people who want to say that somehow the president's case was not strong, the intelligence case was not strong. I've read a lot of intelligence cases over my almost 20 years now in this field, and this was a very strong case. The director of central intelligence put together a national intelligence estimate. That's a disciplined document in which he takes the views of all of the various agencies and then delivers a consensus view to the president. <BR><BR>Gwen Ifill: But a disciplined document, in which it concluded, in many ways, that there wasn't enough of a case to be made on this nuclear option. <BR><BR>Condoleezza Rice: No, in fact, Gwen, when the judgments, the key judgments in the NIE [national intelligence estimate] are quite the opposite from that. It says, for instance,&nbsp;[if] left unchecked Saddam Hussein would possibly have a nuclear weapon by the end of the decade. I don't know what the president of the United States is supposed to do with that except to say I have to have a policy prescription for dealing with that sit—that circumstance. <BR><BR>Five of the six intelligence agencies believed that he had an active program of reconstitution of his nuclear weapons program. And one has to remember that this is against the context of someone who had in 1991, at the end of the Gulf War, been proven to be much closer to a nuclear weapon than the International Atomic Energy Agency had thought. He had been seeking nuclear weapons for a long time. This didn't happen in a vacuum. <BR><BR>In that context, judgments by the intelligence community that he was reconstituting his programs, that he had an active procurement network, that he was gathering together nuclear scientists, that he had several designs for a nuclear weapon, and that left unchecked he might be able to have a nuclear weapon by the end of the decade, that's the judgment on which the president was going, and not the question of whether or not he was trying to acquire yellowcake in Africa. <BR><BR>Gwen Ifill: James Schlesinger, who, as you know, served in several previous administrations and was at one point at least Pentagon secretary, he said on this program last week that George Tenet was forced to fall on his sword. If that's the case, do you regret that? <BR><BR>Condoleezza Rice: Director Tenet, George Tenet, said what he believed, and that is that his agency cleared the speech, that he was responsible for the clearance process of his agency. That's what George Tenet said, and he was describing a process by which we clear presidential speeches, and that is that we go both to the experts, to clear specific parts, and we go to the principal to say do you clear this speech? <BR><BR>But George Tenet, like all of us, would never want to see anything in a presidential speech in which the director of Central Intelligence doesn't have confidence. And so of course I feel responsible for this. It should not have happened to the president, and I'm doing everything that I can to try and make sure that it won't happen again. <BR><BR>We needed to make a connection between a set of clearance comments that were sent to us on many matters, by the way, not just clearance comments on this specific issue, but on many matters, clearance comments that were sent to us in October and this line appearing in the State of the Union. <BR><BR>What we have to do is to go back and make certain that we don't have to depend on someone's memory in order to make that connection. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>But I want to say, again, Gwen, the thing that is concerning here is that the intelligence case against Saddam Hussein and his weapons of mass destruction is a broad and deep case from multiple sources over 12 years, from many different intelligence agencies, from the United Nations itself, from the United Nations inspectors, and we are now in Iraq in a way that we will be able to find out precisely what the case was here with his weapons of mass destruction program.</SPAN> <BR><BR>It's going to take some time. A very able former inspector, David Kay, has an army of—he'd probably object to that. He probably doesn't have enough resources—but he has a lot of people in Iraq who are going through miles of, literally miles of documents, who are interviewing— <BR><BR>Gwen Ifill: The question— <BR><BR>Condoleezza Rice: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>We will know precisely what happened to Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Gwen Ifill: Let me ask you about David Kay because the president said today that he met with David Kay yesterday. Did he provide him with any new information about the search for weapons of mass destruction? <BR><BR>Condoleezza Rice: What the president said to David Kay is take your time, do this in a comprehensive way, do this in a way that makes the case, that looks at all of the evidence, and then tells us the truth about this program. What David Kay did say to me, and to others, is that this is a program that was built for deception over many, many years. <BR><BR>Saddam Hussein was under weapons inspections for a period of time. He was under sanctions. He got to be very good at making certain that no one would be able to uncover the truth of his programs, and so it's not surprising that it's going to take some time to really put this picture together. <BR><BR>And the thing that the president most wanted David Kay to know is that we are patient in finding that out. <BR><BR>Gwen Ifill: So David Kay did not bring the president new information about new discoveries at that meeting yesterday. <BR><BR>Condoleezza Rice: David Kay is going to put this together in a way that is coherent. I think that there is a danger in taking a little piece of evidence here, a little piece of evidence there. He is a very respected and capable weapons inspector. He knows how to read the Iraqi programs, and what he will do is to take these many, many documents. He'll also interview people. If you remember back at the time of the Hans Blix mission, we wanted very much to have scientists interviewed outside of Iraq because we knew that people would not talk openly in this totalitarian country in which people's tongues were cut out for dissent. <BR><BR>We now have an opportunity to interview these people. But even now it is taking some time for people to get accustomed to the fact that they can be interviewed, and their families will not be harmed, but we will put this case together. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>What we knew going into the war was that this man was a threat. He had weapons of mass destruction. He had used them before. He was continuing to try to improve his weapons programs. He was sitting astride one of the most volatile regions in the world, a region out of which the ideologies of hatred had come that led people to slam airplanes into buildings in New York and Washington.</SPAN> <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Something had to be done about that threat and the president to simply allow this brutal dictator, with dangerous weapons, to continue to destabilize the Middle East.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Gwen Ifill: And what you said, going into the war, using very stark language, I believe you were the one who said that you couldn't afford to stand by and watch a, looking for a smoking gun which could become a mushroom cloud. You made not only this case about the potential for purchasing uranium, yellowcake, from Niger, you also said that there were aluminum tube purchases, which indicated that the reconstitution of the nuclear program might be underway. <BR><BR>You also said there were satellite photos that showed that buildings were being rebuilt in places where there had been a nuclear program before. Taken together, this was all to make the point that Saddam Hussein was possibly on the verge of reconstituting a nuclear weapons program. Is that, in retrospect, supportable? <BR><BR>Condoleezza Rice: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>It's absolutely supportable, and listen to the list that you just gave. What this was, was a description of his procurement network. We knew that he had, as Colin Powell talked about in his presentation at the United Nations, an active procurement network to procure items, many of which, by the way, were on the prohibited list of the nuclear suppliers group. There's a reason that they were on the prohibited list of the nuclear supplies group: Magnets, balancing machines, yes, aluminum tubes, about which the consensus view was that they were suitable for use in centrifuges to spin material for nuclear weapons.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Gwen Ifill: That's something that the International Atomic Energy Agency did not agree with. <BR><BR>Condoleezza Rice: Well, the DCI, the director of Central Intelligence, the consensus view of the American intelligence agency, was that given the specifications, given that this had been Saddam Hussein's kind of personal network, given the expense that they had gone to, to get these tubes, that they were most likely for this use, but there were other elements as well—facilities that were being rebuilt. <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>It was a case that said he is trying to reconstitute. He's trying to acquire nuclear weapons. Nobody ever said that it was going to be the next year, but the question was that if it was possible that he might have one by the end of the decade, and if it was possible, as the national intelligence estimate said, that if he acquired fissile material, it might be far sooner than that. Was that a threat that you could allow to sit unanswered?</SPAN> <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>And I'd just like to say one other thing. The nuclear case, yes, was, was an issue, but there was also a very robust biological weapons issue. Biological weapons are also extremely dangerous, as we found out with just a small amount of anthrax on Capitol Hill and at various news outlets in the United States.</SPAN> <BR><BR><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>There was the fear that he might be able to use chemical weapons. This was a bad regime, an extremely tyrannical regime with a history of using weapons of mass destruction, with a 12-year history of everybody in the international community, including three administrations of the United States, President Bush—the first President Bush—President Clinton, and President Bush, the current President Bush, believing that he had weapons of mass destruction.</SPAN> <BR><BR>And when you look at that picture, and you look at this picture in the Middle East, this incredibly volatile region, and you look at his ambitions, Saddam Hussein's ambitions for power in the Middle East that were demonstrated in what he did in Iran and what he would later do in Kuwait, this was a threat that had been out there too long. And as the president said today, we wanted the international community to deal with it— <BR><BR>Gwen Ifill: I mean— <BR><BR>Condoleezza Rice: It sat there and sat there.

Surveying the war's death and destruction—including the loss of hundreds of thousands of American lives—our policymakers set out to work for a Europe where another war was unthinkable. We and the people of Europe committed to the vision of democracy and prosperity, and together we succeeded. <BR><BR>Today America and our friends and allies must commit ourselves to a long-term transformation in another part of the world: the Middle East. A region of 22 countries with a combined population of 300 million, the Middle East has a combined GDP [gross domestic product] less than that of Spain, population 40 million. It is held back by what leading Arab intellectuals call a political and economic ""freedom deficit."" In many quarters a sense of hopelessness provides a fertile ground for ideologies of hatred that persuade people to forsake university educations, careers and families and aspire instead to blow themselves up—taking as many innocent lives with them as possible. <BR><BR>These ingredients are a recipe for regional instability—and pose a continuing threat to America's security. <BR><BR>Our task is to work with those in the Middle East who seek progress toward greater democracy, tolerance, prosperity and freedom. <BR><BR>As President Bush said in February, ""The world has a clear interest in the spread of democratic values, because stable and free nations do not breed ideologies of murder.

And we've got a team of people, lots of people, hundreds of people out there, tracking down, interrogating people, looking at suspect sites. And they're going about it in an orderly way. I mean it's an enormous country. It's the size of California. And we found places where they buried airplanes, MiG fighter aircraft are buried underground. Now think of that. There's lots of things buried there. <BR><BR>Another man took the folks into the backyard near a rosebush and started digging and came up with materials from laboratories. Now is it going to take some time, yes? Has it already taken four and a half months, yes? Is this group proceeding in an orderly, sensible way? Yes. Will at some point they come out and report what they've found? Yes. <BR><BR>Question: Let's cut to the crunch on this question. If in fact this team does not find any weapons of mass destruction, do you believe that would do serious harm to the credibility of the president and this administration and particularly on the—in the long run and when history looks back on this? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: I mean, the intelligence that our country had—has—was over a sustained period of time, it was validated by other intelligence services. I have to believe it was reasonably correct—obviously not perfect. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>No intelligence is ever perfect. And that as the reports come out, they will find evidence of the kinds of programs that Secretary Powell presented to the United Nations. That's my—yes, I mean that's what I believe.</SPAN> <BR><BR>Question: But if they don't? Is that a problem? <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: I don't do hypotheticals. <BR><BR>Question: You don't do politics; you don't do hypotheticals. <BR><BR>Rumsfeld: I don't. I don't. Why?

1120,2004-07-09,"Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, <EM>Report on the U.S. Intelligence Community's Pre-War Intelligence Assessment on Iraq </EM>(Part One)","<P><STRONG>Overall Conclusions Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction</STRONG></B> </P>  <P>Conclusion 1: Most of the major key judgments in the Intelligence Community's October 2002 national intelligence estimate (NIE), ""Iraq's Continuing Programs for Weapons of Mass Destruction,"" either overstate, or were not supported by, the underlying intelligence reporting. A series of failures, particularly in analytic trade craft, led to the mischaracterization of the intelligence. <BR><BR>Conclusion 2: The Intelligence Community did not accurately or adequately explain to policymakers the uncertainties behind the judgments in the October 2002 national intelligence estimate. <BR><BR>Conclusion 3: The Intelligence Community (IC) suffered from a collective presumption that Iraq had an active and growing weapons of mass destruction (WMD) program. This ""group think"" dynamic led Intelligence Community analysts, collectors and managers to both interpret ambiguous evidence as conclusively indicative of a WMD program as well as ignore or minimize evidence that Iraq did not have active and expanding weapons of mass destruction programs. This presumption was so strong that formalized IC mechanisms established to challenge assumptions and group think were not utilized. <BR><BR>Conclusion 4: In a few significant instances, the analysis in the national intelligence estimate suffers from a ""layering"" effect whereby assessments were built based on previous judgments without carrying forward the uncertainties of the underlying judgments. <BR><BR>Conclusion 5: In each instance where the Committee found an analytic or collection failure, it resulted in part from a failure of Intelligence Community managers throughout their leadership chains to adequately supervise the work of their analysts and collectors. They did not encourage analysts to challenge their assumptions, fully consider alternative arguments, accurately characterize the intelligence reporting, or counsel analysts who lost their objectivity. <BR><BR>Conclusion 6: The Committee found significant short-comings in almost every aspect of the Intelligence Community's human intelligence collection efforts against Iraq's weapons of mass destruction activities, in particular that the Community had no sources collecting against weapons of mass destruction in Iraq after 1998. Most, it not all, of these problems stem from a broken corporate culture and poor management, and will not be solved by additional funding and personnel. <BR><BR>Conclusion 7: The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), in several significant instances, abused its unique position in the Intelligence Community, particularly in terms of information sharing, to the detriment of the Intelligence Community's prewar analysis concerning Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs. <BR><BR>Conclusion 8: Intelligence Community analysts lack a consistent post–September 11 approach to analyzing and reporting on terrorist threats. <BR><BR>Conclusion 9: Source protection policies within the Intelligence Community direct or encourage reports officers to exclude relevant detail about the nature of their sources. As a result, analysts community-wide are unable to make fully informed judgments about the information they receive, relying instead on nonspecific source lines to reach their assessments. Moreover, relevant operational data is nearly always withheld from analysts, putting them at a further analytical disadvantage. <BR><BR>Conclusion 10: The Intelligence Community relies too heavily on foreign government services and third party reporting, thereby increasing the potential for manipulation of U.S. policy by foreign interests. <BR><BR>Conclusion 11: Several of the allegations of pressure on Intelligence Community (IC) analysts involved repeated questioning. The Committee believes that IC analysts should expect difficult and repeated questions regarding threat information. Just as the post 9/11 environment lowered the Intelligence Community's reporting threshold, it has also affected the intensity with which policymakers will review and question threat information.</P>",False,"Iraq, WMD","Saddam Hussein, George W.

For most analysts, the information in the report lent more credibility to the original Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) reports on the uranium deal, but State Department Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR) analysts believed that the report supported their assessment that Niger was unlikely to be willing or able to sell uranium to Iraq. <BR><BR>Conclusion 14: The Central Intelligence Agency should have told the vice president and other senior policymakers that it had sent someone to Niger to look into the alleged Iraq–Niger uranium deal and should have briefed the vice president on the former ambassador's findings. <BR><BR>Conclusion 15: The Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) Directorate of Operations should have taken precautions not to discuss the credibility of reporting with a potential source when it arranged a meeting with the former ambassador and Intelligence Community analysts. <BR><BR>Conclusion 16: The language in the October 2002 national intelligence estimate that ""Iraq also began vigorously trying to procure uranium ore and yellowcake"" overstated what the Intelligence Community knew about Iraq's possible procurement attempts. <BR><BR>Conclusion 17: The State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR) dissent on the uranium reporting was accidentally included in the aluminum tube section of the national intelligence estimate (NIE), due in part to the speed in which the NIE was drafted and coordinated. <BR><BR>Conclusion 18: When documents regarding the Iraq–Niger uranium reporting became available to the Intelligence Community in October 2002, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) analysts and operations officers should have made an effort to obtain copies. As a result of not obtaining the documents, CIA Iraq nuclear analysts continued to report on Iraqi efforts to procure uranium from Africa and continued to approve the use of such language in Administration publications and speeches. <BR><BR>Conclusion 19: Even after obtaining the forged documents and being alerted by a State Department Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR) analyst about problems with them, analysts at both the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) did not examine them carefully enough to see the obvious problems with the documents. Both agencies continued to publish assessments that Iraq may have been seeking uranium from Africa. In addition, CIA continued to approve the use of similar language in Administration publications and speeches, including the State of the Union. <BR><BR>Conclusion 20: The Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) comments and assessments about the Iraq–Niger uranium reporting were inconsistent and, at times contradictory. These inconsistencies were based in part on a misunderstanding of a CIA Weapons Intelligence, Nonproliferation, and Arms Control Center (WINPAC) Iraq analyst's assessment of the reporting. The CIA should have had a mechanism in place to ensure that agency assessments and information passed to policymakers were consistent. <BR><BR>Conclusion 21: When coordinating the State of the Union, no Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) analysts or officials told the National Security Council (NSC) to remove the ""16 words"" or that there were concerns about the credibility of the Iraq–Niger uranium reporting. A CIA official's original testimony to the Committee that he told the NSC official to remove the words ""Niger"" and ""500 tons"" from the speech is incorrect. <BR><BR>Conclusion 22: The director of Central Intelligence (DCI) should have taken the time to read the State of the Union speech and fact check it himself. Had he done so, he would have been able to alert the National Security Council (NSC) if he still had concerns about the use of the Iraq–Niger uranium reporting in a presidential speech. <BR><BR>Conclusion 23: The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Defense Humint Service (DHS), or the Navy should have followed up with a West African businessman, mentioned in a Navy report, who indicated he was willing to provide information about an alleged uranium transaction between Niger and Iraq in November 2002. <BR><BR>Conclusion 24: In responding to a letter from Senator Carl Levin on behalf of the Intelligence Community in February 2003, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) should not have said that ""reporting suggests Iraq had attempted to acquire uranium from Niger,"" without indicating that State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR) believed the reporting was based on forged documents, or that the CIA was reviewing the Niger reporting. <BR><BR>Conclusion 25: The Niger reporting was never in any of the drafts of Secretary Powell's United Nations (UN) speech and the Committee has not uncovered any information that showed anyone tried to insert the information into the speech. <BR><BR>Conclusion 26: To date, the Intelligence Community has not published as assessment to clarify or correct its position on whether or not Iraq was trying to purchase uranium from Africa as stated in the national intelligence estimate (NIE). Likewise, neither the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) nor the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), which both published assessments on possible Iraqi efforts to acquire uranium, have ever published assessments outside of their agencies which correct their previous positions.</P>",False,"Iraq, WMD, nuclear, uranium","Saddam Hussein, George W.

The Committee agrees with the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR) alternative view that the available intelligence ""does not add up to a compelling case for reconstitution"" <BR><BR>Conclusion 28: The assessments in the national intelligence estimate (NIE) regarding the timing of when Iraq had begun reconstituting its nuclear programs are unclear and confusing. <BR><BR>Conclusion 29: Numerous intelligence reports provided to the Committee showed that Iraq was trying to procure high-strength aluminum tubes. The committee believes that the information available to the Intelligence Community indicated that these tubes were intended to be used for an Iraqi conventional rocket program and not a nuclear program. <BR><BR>Conclusion 30: The Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) intelligence assessment on July 2, 2001 that the dimensions of the aluminum tubes ""match those of a publicly available gas centrifuge design from the 1950s, known as the Zippe centrifuge"" is incorrect. Similar information was repeated by the CIA in its assessments, including its input to the national intelligence estimate (NIE), and by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) over the next year and a half. <BR><BR>Conclusion 31: The Intelligence Community's position in the national intelligence estimate (NIE) that the composition and dimensions of the aluminum tubes exceeded the requirements for non nuclear applications, is incorrect. <BR><BR>Conclusion 32: The intelligence report on Saddam Hussein's personal interest in the aluminum tubes, if credible, did suggest that the tube procurement was a high priority, but it did not necessarily suggest that the high priority was Iraq's nuclear program. <BR><BR>Conclusion 33: The suggestion in the national intelligence estimate (NIE) that Iraq was paying excessively high costs for the aluminum tubes is incorrect. In addition, 70750t6 aluminum is not considerably more expensive than other more readily available materials for rockets as alleged in the NIE. <BR><BR>Conclusion 34: The National Ground Intelligence Center's (NGIC) analysis that the material composition of the tubes was unusual for rocket motor cases was incorrect, contradicted information the NGIC later provided to the Committee, and represented a serious lapse for the agency with primary responsibility for conventional ground forces intelligence analysis. <BR><BR>Conclusion 35: Information obtained by the Committee shows that the tubes were to be manufactured to tolerances tighter than typically requested for rocket systems. The request for tight tolerances had several equally likely explanations other than that the tubes were intended for a centrifuge program, however. <BR><BR>Conclusion 36: Iraq's attempts to procure the tubes through intermediary countries did appear intended to conceal Iraq as the ultimate end user of the tubes, as suggested in the national intelligence estimate (NIE). Because Iraq was prohibited from importing any military items, it would have had to conceal itself as the end user whether the tubes were intended for a nuclear program or a conventional weapons program, however. <BR><BR>Conclusion 37: Iraq's persistence in seeking numerous foreign sources for the aluminum tubes was not ""inconsistent"" with procurement practices as alleged in the national intelligence estimate (NIE). Furthermore, such persistence was more indicative of procurement for a conventional weapons program than a covert nuclear program. <BR><BR>Conclusion 38: The Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) initial reporting on its aluminum tube spin tests was, at a minimum, misleading and, in some cases, incorrect. The fact that these tests were not coordinated with other Intelligence Community agencies is an example of continuing problems with information sharing within the Intelligence Community. <BR><BR>Conclusion 39: Iraq's performance of hydrostatic pressure tests on the tubes was more indicative of their likely use for a rocket program than a centrifuge program. <BR><BR>Conclusion 40: Intelligence reports which showed [blacked out] were portrayed in the national intelligence estimate as more definitive than the reporting showed. <BR><BR>Conclusion 41: Blacked out <BR><BR>Conclusion 42: The director of Central Intelligence was not aware of the views of all intelligence agencies on the aluminum tubes prior to September 2002 and, as a result, could only have passed the Central Intelligence Agency's view along to the president until that time. <BR><BR>Conclusion 43: Intelligence provided to the Committee did show that Iraq was trying to procure magnets, high-speed balancing machines and machine tools, but this intelligence did not suggest that the materials were intended to be used in a nuclear program. <BR><BR>Conclusion 44: The statement in the national intelligence estimate that ""a large number of personnel for the new [magnet] production facility, worked in Iraq's pre-Gulf War centrifuge program,"" was incorrect. <BR><BR>Conclusion 45: The statement in the national intelligence estimate that the Iraqi Atomic Energy Commission was ""expanding the infrastructure—research laboratories, production facilities, and procurement networks—to produce nuclear weapons,"" is not supported by the intelligence provided to the Committee. <BR><BR>Conclusion 46: The intelligence provided to the Committee which showed that Iraq had kept its cadre of nuclear weapons personnel trained and in positions that could keep their skills intact for eventual use in a reconstituted nuclear program was compelling, but this intelligence did not show that there was a recent increase in activity that would have been indicative of recent or impending reconstitution of Iraq's nuclear program as was suggested in the national intelligence estimate. <BR><BR>Conclusion 47: Intelligence information provided to the Committee did show that Saddam Hussein met with Iraqi Atomic Energy Commission and that some security improvements were taking place, but none of the reporting indicated the IAEC was engaged in nuclear weapons related work.</P>",False,"Iraq, WMD, nuclear","Saddam Hussein, George W.

According to one report, Saddam Hussein's efforts at this time to rebuild relations with the Saudis and other Middle Eastern regimes led him to stay clear of bin Ladin. <BR><BR>In mid-1998, the situation reversed; it was Iraq that reportedly took the initiative. In March 1998, after bin Ladin's public fatwa against the United States, two Al Qaeda members reportedly went to Iraq to meet with Iraqi intelligence. In July, an Iraqi delegation traveled to Afghanistan to meet first with the Taliban and then with bin Ladin. Sources reported that one, or perhaps both, of these meetings was apparently arranged through bin Ladin's Egyptian deputy, Zawahiri, who had ties of his own to the Iraqis. In 1998, Iraq was under intensifying U.S. pressure, which culminated in a series of large air attacks in December. <BR><BR>Similar meetings between Iraqi officials and bin Ladin or his aides may have occurred in 1999 during a period of some reported strains with the Taliban. According to the reporting, Iraqi officials offered bin Ladin a safe haven in Iraq. Bin Ladin declined, apparently judging that his circumstances in Afghanistan remained more favorable than the Iraqi alternative. The reports describe friendly contacts and indicate some common themes in both sides' hatred of the United States.

1142,2004-10-21,Senator Carl Levin and Senate Armed Services Committee Minority Staff Report,"Editor's Note: Senator Carl Levin released an unclassified report that the Senate Armed Services Committee Minority Staff prepared entitled: <EM>Report of an Inquiry into the Alternative Analysis of the Issue of an Iraq–Al Qaeda Relationship.</EM> The report challenged some of the conclusions in the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence [SSCI]&nbsp;Committee report and stated that the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy [during the build up to the war, it was run by Doug Feith] inappropriately produced an alternative analysis. The report stated that analysis provided by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy exaggerated a connection between Iraq and Al Qaeda while the Intelligence Community remained consistently dubious of such a connection. Below you will find the conclusion from the report: <BR><BR>Life and death decisions are based on the accuracy of intelligence. When intelligence is distorted or exaggerated to support the policies of an administration, it jeopardizes our nation's security and the lives of the men and women of our armed forces. This report provides compelling evidence of the importance of objective, independent intelligence upon which to base major policy decisions. It demonstrates how intelligence relating to the Iraq–Al Qaeda relationship was manipulated by high ranking officials in the DOD [Department of Defense] to support the administration's decision to invade Iraq when the intelligence assessments of the professional analysts of the intelligence community [IC]&nbsp;did not provide the desired compelling case. <BR><BR>The IC's analysis of the Iraq–Al Qaeda relationship as a relatively weak one was as definitive as reliable reporting would permit, and their conclusions were subsequently supported by the 9/11 Commission and the SSCI investigations. <BR><BR>Some Senior DOD policymakers were predisposed to conclude that there was a significant relationship between Iraq and Al Qaeda. However, the IC failed to support that conclusion in repeated analyses. An alternative intelligence assessment process was established in the office of Under Secretary for Policy Doug Feith to look at the evidence through a different lens, one that was predisposed to finding a significant relationship between Iraq and Al Qaeda. His staff then conducted its own review of raw intelligence reports, including reporting of dubious quality or reliability. Drawing upon both reliable and unreliable reporting, they arrived at an ""alternative"" interpretation of the Iraq–Al Qaeda relationship that was much stronger than that assessed by the IC and more in accord with the policy views of senior officials in the administration. <BR><BR>The ""alternative"" views of the Iraq–Al Qaeda relationship were provided to senior policymakers both directly, in briefings and written materials later submitted to Congress, and indirectly, by obtaining the inclusion of questionable raw reporting in IC reports to which policymakers could refer. These intelligence activities, which at times included misrepresenting the IC's conclusions and criticizing their standards without the IC's knowledge, went far beyond the normal practices of a policy office. <BR><BR>Misleading or inaccurate statements about the Iraq–Al Qaeda relationship made by senior administration officials were not supported by IC analyses but more closely reflected the Feith policy office views. These assessments included, among others, allegations by the president that Iraq was an ""ally"" of Al Qaeda; assertions by National Security Advisor Rice and others that Iraq ""had"" provided training in WMD to Al Qaeda; and continued representations by Vice President Cheney that Mohammed Atta may have met with an Iraq intelligence officer before the 9/11 attacks when the CIA didn't believe the meeting took place. <BR><BR>Major decisions, such as the decision to take this country to war, should not be based on intelligence shaped to support that decision. The professional objectivity and independence required in the assessment of the Iraq–Al Qaeda relationship, a major reason given for going to war, were compromised to support a predetermined policy—to present the government of Saddam Hussein as an imminent threat to the security of the United States. Corrective legislation, including better congressional oversight, is needed. It is the hope that this report will help support these needed changes.",False,"Iraq, Al Qaeda","Saddam Hussein, George W.

Our report offers 74 recommendations for improving the U.S. Intelligence Community (all but a handful of which we believe can be implemented without statutory change). But among these recommendations a few points merit special emphasis. <BR><BR>We conclude that the Intelligence Community was dead wrong in almost all of its pre-war judgments about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. This was a major intelligence failure. Its principal causes were the Intelligence Community's inability to collect good information about Iraq's WMD programs, serious errors in analyzing what information it could gather, and a failure to make clear just how much of its analysis was based on assumptions, rather than good evidence. On a matter of this importance, we simply cannot afford failures of this magnitude. <BR><BR>After a thorough review, the Commission found no indication that the Intelligence Community distorted the evidence regarding Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. What the intelligence professionals told you about Saddam Hussein's programs was what they believed. They were simply wrong. <BR><BR>As you asked, we looked as well beyond Iraq in our review of the Intelligence Community's capabilities. We conducted case studies of our intelligence agencies' recent performance assessing the risk of WMD in Libya and Afghanistan, and our current capabilities with respect to several of the world's most dangerous state and non-state proliferation threats. Out of this more comprehensive review, we report both bad news and good news.

But it was also a failure on the part of those who collect intelligence—CIA's and the Defense Intelligence Agency's (DIA) spies, the National Security Agency 's (NSA) eavesdroppers, and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency 's (NGA) imagery experts. In the end, those agencies collected precious little intelligence for the analysts to analyze, and much of what they did collect was either worthless or misleading. Finally, it was a failure to communicate effectively with policymakers; the Intelligence Community didn't adequately explain just how little good intelligence it had—or how much its assessments were driven by assumptions and inferences rather than concrete evidence.",False,"Iraq, WMD, chemical, biological, nuclear, uranium","Saddam Hussein, George W.

The report produced 74 recommendations aimed at improving the IC's intelligence gathering. Below is a portion of the letter from the commission to President Bush and brief overviews of the findings related to intelligence concerning Iraq's WMD programs. <BR><BR><B>Overview on Iraq</B> <BR><BR>In October 2002, at the request of members of Congress, the National Intelligence Council produced a national intelligence estimate (NIE)—the most authoritative intelligence assessment produced by the Intelligence Community—which concluded that Iraq was reconstituting its nuclear weapons program and was actively pursuing a nuclear device. According to the exhaustive study of the Iraq Survey Group, this assessment was almost completely wrong. The NIE said that Iraq's biological weapons capability was larger and more advanced than before the Gulf War and that Iraq possessed mobile biological weapons production facilities. This was wrong. The NIE further stated that Iraq had renewed production of chemical weapons, including mustard, sarin, GF, and VX, and that it had accumulated chemical stockpiles of between 100 and 500 metric tons. All of this was also wrong. Finally, the NIE concluded that Iraq had unmanned aerial vehicles that were probably intended for the delivery of biological weapons, and ballistic missiles that had ranges greater than the United Nations' permitted 150 kilometer range. In truth, the aerial vehicles were not for biological weapons; some of Iraq's missiles were, however, capable of traveling more than 150 kilometers. The Intelligence Community's Iraq assessments were, in short, riddled with errors. <BR><BR>Contrary to what some defenders of the Intelligence Community have since asserted, these errors were not the result of a few harried months in 2002. Most of the fundamental errors were made and communicated to policymakers well before the now-infamous NIE of October 2002, and were not corrected in the months between the NIE and the start of the war. They were not isolated or random failings. Iraq had been an intelligence challenge at the forefront of U.S. attention for over a decade. It was a known adversary that had already fought one war with the United States and seemed increasingly likely to fight another. But, after ten years of effort, the Intelligence Community still had no good intelligence on the status of Iraq's weapons programs. Our full report examines these issues in detail. Here we limit our discussion to the central lessons to be learned from this episode. </P>  <P>[text omitted]<BR><BR>Finally, we closely examined the possibility that intelligence analysts were pressured by policymakers to change their judgments about Iraq's nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons programs. The analysts who worked Iraqi weapons issues universally agreed that in no instance did political pressure cause them to skew or alter any of their analytical judgments. That said, it is hard to deny the conclusion that intelligence analysts worked in an environment that did not encourage skepticism about the conventional wisdom.</P>",False,"Iraq, WMD, chemical, biological, nuclear, uranium","Saddam Hussein, George W.

This SSCI report looks at what, if any information, shared by Iraqi exiles was used in intelligence estimates along with comparing prewar intelligence estimates regarding WMD to postwar findings.

Information obtained after the war supports the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research's (INR) assessment in the NIE that the Intelligence Community lacked persuasive evidence that Baghdad had launched a coherent effort to reconstitute its nuclear weapons program. <BR><BR>Conclusion 2: Postwar findings do not support the 2002 national intelligence estimate (NIE) assessment that Iraq's acquisition of high strength aluminum tubes was intended for an Iraqi nuclear program. The findings do support the assessments in the NIE of the Department of Energy's Office of Intelligence and the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR) that the aluminum tubes were likely intended for a conventional rocket program. <BR><BR>Conclusion 3: Postwar findings do not support the 2002 national intelligence estimate (NIE) assessment that Iraq was ""vigorously trying to procure uranium ore and yellowcake"" from Africa. Postwar findings support the assessment in the NIE of the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR) that claims of Iraqi pursuit of natural uranium in Africa are ""highly dubious."" <BR><BR>Conclusion 4: Postwar findings do not support the 2002 national intelligence estimate (NIE) assessment that ""Iraq has biological weapons"" and that ""all key aspects of Iraq's offensive biological weapons (BW) program are larger and more advanced than before the Gulf war."" <BR><BR>Conclusion 5: Postwar findings do not support the 2002 national intelligence estimate (NIE) assessment that Iraq possessed, or ever developed, mobile facilities for producing biological warfare (BW) agents. <BR><BR>Conclusion 6: Concerns existed within the Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) Directorate of Operations (DO) prior to the war about the credibility of the mobile biological weapons program source code-named Curveball. The concerns were based, in part, on doubts raised by the foreign intelligence service that handled Curveball and a third service. The Committee has no information that these concerns were conveyed to policymakers, including members of the U.S. Congress, prior to the war. The Committee is continuing to investigate issues regarding prewar concerns about Curveball's credibility. <BR><BR>Conclusion 7: Postwar findings do not support the 2002 national intelligence estimate (NIE) assessment that Iraq ""has chemical weapons"" or ""is expanding its chemical industry to support chemical weapons (CW) production."" <BR><BR>Conclusion 8: Postwar findings do not support the 2002 national intelligence estimate (NIE) assessment that Iraq had missiles which exceeded United Nations (UN) range limits. The findings do not support the assessment that Iraq likely retained a covert force of SCUD variant short range ballistic missiles (SRBMs). <BR><BR>Conclusion 9: Postwar findings do not support the 2002 national intelligence estimate (NIE) assessment that Iraq had a developmental program for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) ""probably intended to deliver biological agents"" or that an effort to procure U.S. mapping software ""strongly suggests that Iraq is investigating the use of these UAVs for missions targeting the United States.""

The report looks at what, if any, information shared by Iraqi exiles was used in intelligence estimates&nbsp;and compares prewar intelligence estimates regarding&nbsp;weapons of mass destruction&nbsp;to postwar findings. Here are the significant conclusions from the declassified report. <BR><BR><B>Conclusions Regarding Iraqi Links to Al Qaeda</B> <BR><BR>Conclusion 1: Postwar findings indicate that the Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) assessment that the relationship between Iraq and Al Qaeda resembled ""two independent actors trying to exploit each other"" accurately characterized bin Ladin's actions, but not those of Saddam Hussein. Postwar findings indicate that Saddam Hussein was distrustful of Al Qaeda and viewed Islamic extremists as a threat to his regime, refusing all requests from Al Qaeda to provide material or operational support. <BR><BR>Conclusion 2: Postwar findings have identified only one meeting between representatives of Al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein's regime reported in prewar intelligence assessments. Postwar findings have identified two occasions, not reported prior to the war, in which Saddam Hussein rebuffed meeting requests from an Al Qaeda operative. The Intelligence Community has not found any other evidence of meetings between Al Qaeda and Iraq. <BR><BR>Conclusion 3: Prewar intelligence community assessments were inconsistent regarding the likelihood that Saddam Hussein provided chemical and biological weapons (CBW) training to Al Qaeda. Postwar findings support the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) February 2002 assessment that Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi was likely intentionally misleading his debriefers when he said that Iraq provided two Al Qaeda associates with chemical and biological weapons (CBW) training in 2000. The Central Intelligence Agency's January 2003 assessment said the al-Libi claim was credible, but included the statement that al-Libi was not in a position to know whether the training had taken place. Postwar findings do not support the CIA's assessment that his reporting was credible. No postwar information has been found that indicates CBW training occurred and the detainee who provided the key prewar reporting about this training recanted his claims after the war. <BR><BR>Conclusion 4: Postwar findings support the April 2002 Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) assessment that there was no credible reporting on Al Qaeda training at Salman Pak or anywhere else in Iraq. <BR><BR>Conclusion 5: Postwar information supports the Intelligence Community's assessments that Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, using an alias, and members of his network, were present in Baghdad in 2002. Postwar findings indicate al-Zarqawi was in Baghdad from May 2002 until late November 2002, when he traveled to Iran and northeastern Iraq. Prewar assessments expressed uncertainty about Iraq's complicity in their presence, but overestimated the Iraqi regime's capabilities to locate them. Postwar information indicates that Saddam Hussein attempted, unsuccessfully, to locate and capture al-Zarqawi and that the regime did not have a relationship with, harbor, or turn a blind eye toward Zarqawi. <BR><BR>Conclusion 6: Postwar information indicates that the Intelligence Community accurately assessed that Al Qaeda affiliate group Ansar al-Islam operated in Kurdish-controlled northeastern Iraq, an area that Baghdad had not controlled since 1991. Prewar assessments reported on Iraqi Intelligence Service (IIS) infiltrations of the group, but noted uncertainty regarding the purpose of the infiltrations. Postwar information reveals that Baghdad viewed Ansar al-Islam as a threat to the regime and that the IIS attempted to collect intelligence on the group. <BR><BR>Conclusion 7: Postwar information supports prewar Intelligence Community assessments that there was no credible information that Iraq was complicit in or had foreknowledge of the September 11 attacks or any other Al Qaeda strike. These assessments discussed two leads which raised the possibility of ties between Iraqi officials and two of the September 11 hijackers. Postwar findings support CIA's January 2003 assessment, which judged that ""the most reliable reporting casts doubt"" on one of the leads, an alleged meeting between Muhammad Atta and an Iraqi intelligence officer in Prague, and confirm that no such meeting occurred. Prewar intelligence reporting cast doubt on the other lead as well. <BR><BR>Conclusion 8: No postwar information indicates that Iraq intended to use Al Qaeda or any other terrorist group to strike the United States homeland before or during Operation Iraqi Freedom. <BR><BR>Conclusion 9: While document exploitation continues, additional reviews of documents recovered in Iraq are unlikely to provide information that would contradict the committee's findings or conclusions.",False,"Iraq, WMD, chemical, biological, nuclear","Saddam Hussein, George W.

Here are some of the significant conclusions. <BR><BR><B>Conclusions Regarding Inadequate Procedures</B></P>  <P>The OUSD(P) [Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy] developed, produced, and disseminated alternative intelligence assessments which included some conclusions that were inconsistent with the intelligence community's vetted intelligence products because procedures for preparing alternative assessments were insufficient to ensure that the OUSD(P) products clearly reflected any disagreements or variance with the intelligence community. Although not required, the OUSD(P) could have used the DIA [Defense Intelligence Agency] detailees to follow the existing DIA procedures to request an alternative judgment on the relationship between Iraq and Al Qaeda from the defense intelligence community. Two DIA personnel detailed to OUSD(P) should have been aware of existing procedures and could have used them. <BR><BR>DIA DI Policy No. 004 explains the methods that Defense Intelligence uses to address alternative judgments in those rare instances where consensus cannot be reached. <BR><BR>The first and preferred method for incorporating an alternative analysis is through the standard process of coordination. Analysts are expected to marshal their facts, build coherent arguments, and defend those arguments while coordinating with other experts across the intelligence iommunity. In the vast majority of cases, analytic judgments either stand or fall on the merits of their evidentiary base, intrinsic logic, and quality. In those rare instances where analysts build a strong case, but cannot achieve consensus support for their analysis, an alternative judgment is justified. <BR><BR>While the DIA DI Policy does not apply to OUSD(P) personnel, we believe that the DIA detailee who prepared the July 25, 2002, memorandum, ""Iraq and al-Qaida: Making the Case,"" could have used the standard coordination process to obtain consensus from the intelligence community or followed the procedures for developing an alternative judgment. Instead, the DIA detailee provided the July 25, 2002, memorandum as an appeal to publish the alternative intelligence assessment as an ""Intelligence Finding."" In spite of never gaining intelligence community agreement to publish the alternative intelligence assessments as an Intelligence Finding, the OUSD(P) disseminated the briefing, ""Assessing the Relationship Between Iraq and al-Qaida,"" in August 2002 produced from the July 25, 2003, memorandum.</P>",False,"Iraq, WMD, chemical, biological, nuclear","Saddam Hussein, Douglas Feith",,,"SOURCE: Deputy Inspector General for Intelligence, <EM>Review of the Pre-Iraqi War Activities of the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy </EM>(U.S. Department of Defense, 2007), pages 13–14.",

But when your memo is immediately bounced and it's got very current information and it's bounced back to you and you're told to do over, it's pretty clear what the implication is. <BR><BR>Borger: What do you think drove these people on Iraq? <BR><BR>Clarke: Some are ideologues—they have a superpower vision of us reshaping the Middle East. Changing the historical balance. Condi Rice has this phrase: ""We needed to change the Middle East so terrorists would not fly aircrafts into buildings.""<BR><BR>Borger: Do you believe they felt they had to finish what Bush's father started? <BR><BR>Clarke: That's a big part of it. For Wolfowitz and Cheney feels some guilt for having stopped the war, a couple of days early, not that we should have marched on Baghdad but at least we should have gone after the Republican Guard. <BR><BR>Borger: Do you believe there were also political motives? <BR><BR>Clarke: You have to bifurcate the White House team between the national security types and the political types. For the political types like Karl Rove this has been a godsend. They ran on the war in the congressional elections two years ago. They're running on the war now. They're painting this election as a vote on terrorism, a vote against Osama bin Laden. And they're succeeding to a certain extent because 70 per cent of American people last year thought that Iraq had something to do with 9/11. But the political benefit clearly a secondary benefit. <BR><BR>Borger: Do you believe the administration believed the intelligence on Iraqi WMD [weapons of mass destruction]? <BR><BR>Clarke: We all believed Saddam had WMD. What I kept saying was: So what? They said he could give it to terrorists. But I said he's not that stupid. If he gave WMD to terrorists he would lose power. The question was: Is there an imminent threat or had we contained him? And I thought we had successfully contained him. I didn't see it as a first-tier issue. <BR><BR>Borger: Did the Pentagon and the office of special plans play an important role in the processing of intelligence? <BR><BR>Clarke: Certainly. The people in Rumsfeld's office and in Wolfowitz's operation cherry-picked intelligence to select the intelligence to support their views. They never did the due diligence on the intelligence that professional intelligence analysts are trained to do. [The OSP] would go through the intelligence reports, including the ones that the CIA was throwing out. They stitched it together they would send it out, send it over to Cheney. All the stuff that a professional would have thrown out. As soon as 9/11 happened, people like Rumsfeld saw it was opportunity. During that first week after September 11, the decision was made. It was confirmed by the president: We should do Afghanistan first. But the resources necessary to do a good job in Afghanistan were withheld. There was not enough to go in fast, to go in enough to secure the country. Troops were held back. There were 11,000 troops in Afghanistan. There were fewer in the whole country than police in the borough of Manhattan. <BR><BR>Borger: The White House is suggesting that this is sour grapes from a Clinton holdover, scoring political points. <BR><BR>Clarke: I was a Bush [senior] holdover. I'm not a registered Democrat. I don't want a job in the Kerry administration.

1158,2004-09-21,"Richard Clarke, <EM>Against All Enemies</EM>: Richard Clarke,&nbsp;Personal Conclusions Concerning Iraq's Ties to Weapons of Mass Destruction","Time and again the [Bush] administration claimed that there was an urgency to act against Iraq because there was a growing threat to the United States. They were generally vague about the details of the threat, but left the impression that it stemmed from weapons of mass destruction, i.e., chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons about to be used against us by Iraq. Like most national security bureaucrats, I believed Iraq had chemical and/or biological weapons in 2003. We knew that Iraq had them in 1992 and later because we had seen them. Iraq gave every indication that they were hiding some in 1998, but there was no reliable intelligence on what had happened to them since 1998. Charles Duelfer was the leading American expert on the issue, having spent over a decade working on Iraqi WMD analysis for the United States&nbsp;and the United Nations.&nbsp;Duelfer thought in 2002 that there was no remaining large and threatening stockpile. He was ignored before the invasion and for months after and only asked by the Administration to go to Iraq to lead the investigation in 2004. <BR><BR>As studies by the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Carnegie Endowment have made clear, both the CIA and the president failed to tell the Congress and the American people that they were making judgments about the Iraqi WMD threat based on dated information. As WMD inspector David Kay was forced to admit, ""we were all wrong, probably."" <BR><BR>Even if Iraq still had WMD stockpiles, possession of weapons of mass destruction is not in and of itself a threat to the United States. Over two dozen nations possess WMD, according to unclassified CIA testimony to Congress. Never did I think the Iraqi chemical or biological weapons were an imminent threat to the United States in 2002. <BR><BR>Saddam had ample opportunity to use them on the United States&nbsp;for over a decade and did not. As to nuclear weapons, Iraq had demonstrated its ability to create a large, covert nuclear weapons development program in 1991. CIA had demonstrated its inability to notice such a large program. Together, those two facts were a legitimate source of concern. The means to deal with that risk were present, however, in intrusive inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency, active control of Iraqi imports related to nuclear development, and the use of other nations' intelligence services. Indeed, those methods may have been successful because (as we now know) there was no active nuclear weapons program in 2002. Nothing in 2002 indicated Saddam intended to build nukes, much less use them, and certainly not imminently. Indeed CIA's publicly released analysis concluded that there was little risk of Iraq's WMD against the United States&nbsp;unless we attacked them. <BR><BR>Both the White House and the CIA must have known there was no ""imminent threat"" to the United States, but one claimed the opposite, and the other allowed them to do so uncorrected.",False,"Iraq, WMD, chemical, biological, nuclear, Al Qaeda","Saddam Hussein, George W.

1159,2004-02-05,"CIA Director George Tenet, Speech at Georgetown University","<P>Let's turn to Iraq. Much of the current controversy centers on our prewar intelligence, summarized in the National Intelligence Estimate of October of 2002. <BR><BR>National estimates are publications where the intelligence community as a whole seeks to sum up what we know about a subject, what we don't know, what we suspect may be happening and where we differ on key issues. <BR><BR>This estimate asked if Iraq had chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them. We concluded that in some of these categories Iraq had weapons, and that in others where it did not have them, it was trying to develop them. <BR><BR>Let me be clear: Analysts differed on several important aspects of these programs and those debates were spelled out in the estimate. <BR><BR>They never said there was an imminent threat. Rather, they painted an objective assessment for our policy-makers of a brutal dictator who was continuing his efforts to deceive and build programs that might constantly surprise us and threaten our interests. No one told us what to say or how to say it. <BR><BR>How did we reach our conclusions? We had three streams of information; none perfect, but each important.</P>  <P>[text omitted]</P>  <P>Did these strands of information weave into a perfect picture? Could they answer every question? No, far from it. But taken together, this information provided a solid basis on which to estimate whether Iraq did or did not have weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them. <BR><BR>It is important to underline the word ""estimate,"" because not everything we analyze can be known to a standard of absolute proof. <BR><BR>Now, what exactly was in the October estimate? Why did we say it and what does the postwar evidence thus far show? <BR><BR>But before we start, let me be direct about an important fact. As we meet here today, the Iraq Survey Group is continuing its important search for people and data. And despite some public statements, we are nowhere near 85 percent finished. The men and women who work in that dangerous environment are adamant about that fact. <BR><BR>Any call that I make today is necessarily provisional. Why? Because we need more time and we need more data.</P>  <P>[text omitted]</P>  <P>As director of central intelligence, I also have an important responsibility. I have a responsibility to evaluate our performance, both our operational work and our analytical tradecraft. <BR><BR>So what do I think about all this today? Based on an assessment of the data we collected over the past 10 years, it would have been difficult for analysts to come to any different conclusions than the ones reached in October of 2002. <BR><BR>However, in our business simply saying this is not good enough. We must constantly review the quality of our work. For example, the National Intelligence Council is reviewing the estimate line by line. <BR><BR>Six months ago, we also commissioned an internal review to examine the tradecraft of our work on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. And through this effort we are finding ways to improve our processes. <BR><BR>For example, we recently discovered that relevant analysts in the community missed the notice that identified a source that we had cited as providing information that in some cases was unreliable and in other cases fabricated. <BR><BR>We have acknowledged this mistake.</P>",False,"Iraq, WMD, chemical, biological, nuclear","Saddam Hussein, George W.

You didn't need a pitch-perfect ear to know that they would be contentious and politically charged. I was going to be called to testify whether I was still DCI [Director of Central Intelligence] or not, but the Agency was sure to be thrown into turmoil by the hearings. I couldn't in good conscience leave that mess waiting for whoever my successor might be. <BR><BR>So I settled back into the DCI's chair, continued to put in the long hours, and did everything I could to keep morale high at an Agency that was being stretched perilously thin by Afghanistan, Iraq, and the global war on terror. As I had been doing for years, I also worried day and night about what Al Qaeda and other like-minded groups might next have in store for us. <BR><BR>On February 5, 2004, I delivered a major speech at Georgetown University, laying out the Agency's record on Iraqi WMD and affirming our professional commitment to call them as we saw them. Seven weeks later, on March 24, and again on April 14, I testified publicly before the 9/11 Commission. Both commission appearances were grueling experiences. In the end, though, I tried to represent the Agency well. Then, on April 17, three days after my last appearance before the 9/11 Commission, I picked up my <EM>Washington Post,</EM> saw the front-page story touting Bob Woodward's new book on the run-up to the Iraq war, and read the following in the second paragraph of the story: <BR><BR>""The intensive war planning throughout 2002 created its own momentum, according to <EM>Plan of Attack</EM> by Bob Woodward, fueled in part by the CIA's conclusion that Saddam Hussein could not be removed from power except through a war and CIA Director George J.

Woodward's books, dependent as they are on insider access, have long been used in just this way—to deflect blame and set up fall guys. Now it had happened to me. <BR><BR>[text omitted]<BR><BR>I like the president, plain and simple. We had been bound together after 9/11 by a national trauma and a common purpose.

His staff, though, had different priorities. For them, preserving the president's reputation—particularly with an election coming up and a war plan coming apart—was job one. Perhaps I was just collateral damage. <BR><BR>Maybe my second day at the shore, I phoned Andy Card at the White House and laid it on the line for him. ""Andy,"" I remember saying, ""I'm calling to tell you that I'm really angry. Yes, we wrote a National Intelligence Estimate, we expressed our confidence levels, John McLaughlin and I briefed almost every member of Congress; we were fairly strident about the fact that we believed Saddam had weapons of mass destruction.

One took place outside Washington, and we will come to that shortly. The other—the case of Curveball, the code name allocated to an Iraqi defector who had turned up in a German refugee camp in 1998 and made startling claims about Saddam's mobile biological weapons laboratories—unfolded at the White House, the Pentagon, and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the CIA.

There are many reasons for this, but in my view, the most important one is that the policy was shaping the intelligence and not the other way around.

Two weeks ago he spoke to a Washington public policy Institute. <BR><BR>Wilkerson: What I saw was a cabal between the vice president of the United States, Richard Cheney, and the secretary of defense, Donald Rumsfeld, on critical issues that made decisions that the bureaucracy did not know were being made. <BR><BR>Suarez: In an interview this week, Wilkerson repeated his charge that an alternate decision-making process had evolved run by the vice president and his allies at the Defense Department in the first Bush term. <BR><BR>Wilkerson: This is the first time that so much power has been concentrated in the office of the vice president. <BR><BR>While the formal process was engaged — that is to say, everyone debating and dissenting and so forth and so on — the informal process was making the decisions. <BR><BR>There was a labyrinth out there of people who sopped up information, manipulated information, handed information, and built information, I think in some cases, that supplemented, augmented, helped this alternative decision-making process to realize its decisions rather than those that might have been flummoxed or stopped or halted or still in debate in the formal process. <BR><BR>Suarez: How did this work in practice? <BR><BR>Wilkerson: Well, with regard to Iraq, it was centered in Undersecretary of Defense Douglas Feith's office. Other people were sprinkled throughout the government. <BR><BR>Suarez: Wilkerson says that a faction of the Central Intelligence Agency was aligned with the vice president's office. At times, this group was in conflict with CIA Director George Tenet, the DCI [Director of Central Intelligence]. <BR><BR>Wilkerson: And so, you would get one part of the agency, the official part, if you will, with the DCI as the mouthpiece of that official part, saying: ""Wait a minute. I don't think that ought to go in the president's state of the union address; that's not right. We don't have firm evidence that Iraq is seeking uranium from the country of Niger, so it shouldn't go in there."" <BR><BR>Then you would have this dissenting body in the agency report up the chain to the vice president's office and back in it would go, into the state of the union address. <BR><BR>Suarez: Isn't this just an appropriate outgrowth of the Cabinet process? <BR><BR>Wilkerson: I don't think a president, if he's a wise man, is ever going to trust the critical decisions that send men and women to die, and kill other people too—we forget that sometimes—to just a small entourage.",False,"Iraq, WMD, chemical, biological, nuclear","Saddam Hussein, George W.

President Bush this week went up that hill to—among other things—remind us that we ""remain on the offensive"" against the forces of terror. One way to do that is to be sure we have the best intelligence possible about what bad guys are really up to. That's a point the president himself made while defending his power to tap some international phone calls without court permission. But national security experts say we also need to be sure that the information we do gather doesn't get twisted and distorted as it filters through the corridors of power behind us. <BR><BR>A case in point: what we really knew about Iraq during the march toward war. Administration officials were wrong about the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, but the question is, when did they know that? Bryan Myers produced our report. <BR><BR>It was one of the most anticipated speeches of our generation. On the morning of February 5th, 2003, Secretary of State Colin Powell sat down before the United Nations to make the case for war. <BR><BR>Powell speech (February 5, 2003): The gravity of this moment is matched by the gravity of the threat that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction pose to the world. <BR><BR>Brancaccio: If ever the whole world was watching, this was it. Powell played secretly recorded phone calls, waved a vial of powder representing anthrax, and showed off diagrams of weapons factories. Not since Adlai Stevenson displayed photos of Cuban missiles in 1962 had the U.N. seen such a multi-media tour de force. <BR><BR>Powell: My colleagues, every statement I make today is backed up by sources, solid sources. These are not assertions. What we're giving you are facts and conclusions based on solid intelligence. <BR><BR>Brancaccio: Lawrence Wilkerson was at the center of the action that day, working as a top aide to Colin Powell. What he later found out shocked him: Much of Powell's speech was false. <BR><BR>Lawrence Wilkerson: I participated in a hoax on the American people, the international community, and the United Nations Security Council. How do you think that makes me feel? <BR><BR>Brancaccio: As Powell's Chief of Staff, Wilkerson was intimately involved in preparing that U.N. address. Wilkerson is so upset by what happened, he says he can no longer remain silent. <BR><BR>Brancaccio: A hoax, that's quite a word. <BR><BR>Wilkerson: Well, let's face it. It was. It was not a hoax that the secretary in any way was complicit in. In fact, he did his best. I watched him work to try and hone the presentation down to what was a slam dunk. Firm. Ironclad. <BR><BR>I recall vividly the secretary of state walking into my office. And he said, looking out the window, just musing. He said, ""I wonder what we'll do if we put half a million troops on the ground in Iraq and comb the country from one end to the other and don't find a single weapon of mass destruction."" <BR><BR>Brancaccio: And that's what's happened. <BR><BR>Wilkerson: That's what's happened.",False,"Iraq, WMD, chemical, biological, nuclear","Saddam Hussein, George W.

This meant selectively adducing data—""cherry-picking""—rather than using the intelligence community's own analytic judgments. In fact, key portions of the administration's case explicitly rejected those judgments. In an August 2002 speech, for example, Vice President Dick Cheney observed that ""intelligence is an uncertain business"" and noted how intelligence analysts had underestimated how close Iraq had been to developing a nuclear weapon before the 1991 Persian Gulf War. His conclusion—at odds with that of the intelligence community—was that ""many of us are convinced that Saddam will acquire nuclear weapons fairly soon."" <BR><BR>In the upside-down relationship between intelligence and policy that prevailed in the case of Iraq, the administration selected pieces of raw intelligence to use in its public case for war, leaving the intelligence community to register varying degrees of private protest when such use started to go beyond what analysts deemed credible or reasonable. The best-known example was the assertion by President George W. Bush in his 2003 State of the Union address that Iraq was purchasing uranium ore in Africa. U.S. intelligence analysts had questioned the credibility of the report making this claim, had kept it out of their own unclassified products, and had advised the White House not to use it publicly.

It's much more than that; that is to say, [I was] exposed to the same things that all American citizens were exposed to in interpreting where this administration was going, as opposed to any special requests or special tasks laid on the intelligence community. Although indeed, there was a lot of that with regard to trying to support the notion of a cooperative relationship with Al Qaeda. <BR><BR>Question: At least the way the story is told by [journalist] Bob Woodward, is that even then the president is asking [Defense Secretary Donald] Rumsfeld to begin war plans.

1176,2004-01-01,"Paul Pillar, Former CIA Counterterrorism Analyst, Excerpt From&nbsp;<EM>Terrorism and U.S. Foreign Policy</EM>","<P>What was new about Iraq and terrorism was the U.S. administration's use of the militant post-9/11 mood of the American people to win support for the toppling of Saddam Hussein through military force. Such a military expedition had been a long-standing goal of some senior members of the Bush administration and like-minded opinion makers outside it, chiefly for reasons other than terrorism. What 9/11 did was to so outrage Americans that the public was willing to entertain aggressive and forceful measures in the name of national security that it would not have accepted earlier. This made it politically feasible for the first time to launch an offensive war against Iraq even in the absence of a specific Iraqi provocation. Since the post-9/11 mood was created by a terrorist act, seizing this political opportunity meant emphasizing whatever association could be made between Iraq and terrorism. More specifically, it meant uncovering and highlighting any possible connections between Iraq and Al Qaeda—even if without this policy imperative the connections would barely rise above the level of background noise amid the plethora of reported contacts and ""links"" among individuals, groups, and state agents that characterize the daily flow of intelligence on international terrorism. <BR><BR>Such links range from the most incidental (or coincidental) contacts to full-blown alliances or sponsorship. Much of the public discussion of Iraq and terrorism during the year and a half preceding the launching of the war in March 2003 overlooked the key question about any relationship between a state and a terrorist group: is the state making the group more capable of conducting deadly attacks or even instigating such attacks? The discussion treated the existence or nonexistence of a link, however inconclusive or inconsequential, as if it were the question that mattered most. Some of the least edifying contributions to the discussion were on the editorial and op-ed pages, where the standards of evidence tend to be looser than in official statements. This was where suggestions were made that the links between the Saddam regime and Al Qaeda may have extended to the 9/11 operation itself—a tantalizing proposition that, if it had been confirmed, would have provided the strongest possible argument for going to war. Added to all the minutiae on empirical links was a constant rhetorical linkage between the ""war on terrorism"" and the war on Iraq. Proponents of the war used every opportunity to depict it as ""part of the war on terrorism."" Much press coverage—whether for editorial convenience or for other reasons—followed suit, with ""War on Terrorism"" being a banner caption for television reports on Iraq, and newspaper stories on both Iraq and terrorism being placed in the same special sections. <BR><BR>An important pertinent statement was a presentation on Iraq by Secretary of State Colin Powell to the United Nations Security Council in February 2003. The statement was based on intelligence and made heavy use of hitherto classified information. It was carefully prepared, with the White House and several agencies participating in the preparation. It also admittedly was advocacy—an effort by the United States to make the best possible case for something about Saddam Hussein. As such, it could be expected to use material that would support the case, to omit material that would undermine the case, and to convey ambiguous material in a manner favorable to the case.</P>  <P>[text omitted]</P>  <P>The American public's understanding of most issues involving U.S. foreign and security policy does not rest on detailed perusal of what a secretary of state says at the United Nations. And in this case it did not reflect careful analysis of what the available information indicated about whether Saddam Hussein's regime had made Al Qaeda more able or willing to attack the United States. It rested instead on a much vaguer sense of whether the concepts ""Iraq"" and ""Al Qaeda"" go together. That sense was acquired through the public's exposure to repeated mention of the two subjects in the same breath, to the many hints and suggestive references to links, and to the larger conceptual blurring that resulted from applying the term ""war on terrorism"" to the fights against both Al Qaeda and Iraq. The impact of that exposure has depended more on the quantity than on the quality of what the public heard.</P>",False,"Iraq, WMD, chemical, biological, nuclear, Al Qaeda","Saddam Hussein, George W.

For many working at the agency, there was a renewed sense of mission as they drew together to fight a common enemy—terrorism in general and Al Qaeda in particular. But within a few months, for many the morale once again began to drop through the floor as they began getting pressure to come up with Saddam Hussein's fingerprints on 9/11 and Al Qaeda. <BR><BR>One of those who felt the pressure was a DO case officer who spent years running agents overseas, but who had been reassigned to the unit charged with finding weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in Iraq, a part of the Counter-Proliferation Division. According to the official, the group never found any indications of WMD in Iraq. ""Where I was working, I never saw anything—no one else there did either,"" the person said. <BR><BR>Nevertheless, there was a great deal of pressure to find a reason to go to war with Iraq. And the pressure was not just subtle, it was blatant. At one point in January 2003, the person's boss called a meeting and gave them their marching orders. ""And he said, 'You know what—if Bush wants to got to war, it's your job to give him a reason to do so,'"" according to the official. It was the first time the official had ever heard anyone order employees to slant their analysis for political purposes. <BR><BR>""And I said, 'All right, it's time, it's time to go,'"" said the official. ""I remember, when it happened I looked around and I said, 'This is awful.' He said it at the weekly office meeting. And I just remember saying, 'This is something that the American public, if they ever heard, if they ever knew, they would be outraged.' The fact that we're sitting in the meeting and we're not outraged at this, and we can't do anything—it was just against every moral fiber of my being. He said, 'If President Bush wants to go to war, ladies and gentlemen, your job's to give him a reason to do so.' . . . He said it to about 50 people. And it's funny because everyone still talks about that—'Remember when [he] said that.'"" <BR><BR>Though the case officer still holds a very high security clearance and works on similar activities within the intelligence community, the person left the WMD unit. It is the cult of secrecy within the CIA, the person said, that keeps people from speaking out. ""No one is willing to say the emperor has no clothes—no one is willing to say that,"" said the official. ""Your job is just to salute and say okay . . . I said to another colleague how embarrassed I was, and he said you better be careful, someone's going to report you."" <BR><BR>When the official arrived in the office, others there mentioned that Vice President Cheney had also made very unusual visits to the agency to pressure analysts to come up with something to justify the war. ""Before I got there,"" said the official, ""Cheney came and literally went around to people saying find something. I was in there at the time when everyone said, 'Remember when Cheney came in, said we needed to find something nuclear?'

Meanwhile, the garbage was being shoved straight to the president."" <BR><BR>A routine settled in: the Pentagon's defector reports, classified ""secret,"" would be funneled to newspapers, but subsequent analyses of the reports by intelligence agencies—scathing but also classified—would remain secret.

A few months after George Bush took office, Greg Thielmann, of the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR), was assigned to be the daily intelligence liaison to John Bolton, the undersecretary of state for arms control and international security, who is a prominent conservative. Thielmann understood that his posting had been mandated by Secretary of State Colin Powell, who thought that every important State Department bureau should be assigned a daily intelligence officer. ""Bolton was the guy with whom I had to do business,"" Thielmann said. ""We were going to provide him with all the information he was entitled to see. That's what being a professional intelligence officer is all about."" <BR><BR>But, Thielmann told me, ""Bolton seemed to be troubled because INR was not telling him what he wanted to hear."" <BR><BR>Thielmann soon found himself shut out of Bolton's early-morning staff meetings. ""I was intercepted at the door of his office and told, 'The undersecretary doesn't need you to attend this meeting anymore.'"" When Thielmann protested that he was there to provide intelligence input, the aide said, ""The Undersecretary wants to keep this in the family."" <BR><BR>Eventually, Thielmann said, Bolton demanded that he and his staff have direct electronic access to sensitive intelligence, such as foreign-agent reports and electronic intercepts. In previous administrations, such data had been made available to undersecretaries only after it was analyzed, usually in the specially secured offices of INR. The whole point of the intelligence system in place, according to Thielmann, was ""to prevent raw intelligence from getting to people who would be misled.""

The existence of the camp was one of the most tightly held secrets in the government. When Senator Bob Graham, the intelligence committee chairman, was first briefed on the training plan, he immediately thought of another era—when the CIA, in the early 1960s, had trained Cuban exiles in southern Florida for the disastrous invasion of Cuba that became known as the Bay of Pigs. The camp was located at the Energy Department's Nuclear Test Site, a vast isolated tract of land 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas and one of the most restricted stretches of territory in the country. Dozens of Iraqis had been brought to the site—some smuggled into the country—to train for a mission that Maguire and other CIA paramilitary officials hoped would trigger a war. <BR><BR>The plan was a core element of the original Anabasis program. These were the CIA-backed commandoes who would seize control of an isolated Iraqi base at Nukhaib, near the Saudi border. Then they would go on the radio, announce a coup was under way, call on military unites within Iraq to join them, and request that other nations support their bid to topple Saddam. Saddam, the thinking went, would be compelled to send troops to regain the base. But that would require him to violate the no-fly zone. The United States and Britain would then have a reason to attack Saddam's forces, and the war would be on. The Bush administration, Maguire later said, ""was too wedded"" to the WMD argument for war.

On February 5, 2004, the one-year anniversary of Powell's WMD presentation to the U.N., he made a rare public speech at Georgetown University. <BR><BR>[text omitted]<BR><BR>In a sense, Tenet was asking that there be little or no price to pay for being wrong. Given the aftermath of 9/11 and the ongoing Al Qaeda threat, the CIA had adopted a mentality of warning-at-any-cost. For years the problem had been getting the attention of the policy makers and the public. Of course, it was one thing to be wrong about warning of an attack on the United States. Tenet and all the senior officials in the CIA were certain Al Qaeda would attack again. Deputy Director for Operations James Pavitt told associates in early 2004, ""We'll still get hit again. We'll still get a massive hit of some kind. Absolutely. Absolutely."" But, he added, ""If five years passes, six years, seven years passes and we don't have one, I will be perfectly satisfied and comfortable having been wrong."" But being wrong about information that Saddam possessed biological and chemical weapons—the basis for war—could hardly leave anyone satisfied and comfortable. <BR><BR>As Tenet went over the intelligence again and again, he acknowledged to associates that the CIA and he should have stated up front in the NIE [national intelligence estimate] and in other intelligence that the evidence was not ironclad, that it did not include a smoking gun. <BR><BR>""Holy shit!"" Powell said to himself as he read a copy of Tenet's speech. Here was the CIA director saying that the aluminum tubes they had previously been so confident were for use as centrifuges for enriching uranium were possible for regular artillery shells. Powell remembered that he had challenged them on this before his U.N. presentation a year ago. John McLaughlin had gone into a long recitation about the thickness of the walls of the tubes and the spinning rates, arguing they had to be for centrifuges. Now Tenet was saying, ""We have additional data to collect and more sources to question,"" and his agency ""may have overestimated"" the progress Saddam was making on development of nuclear weapons. Powell felt let down. <BR><BR>Tenet was also backing away from previous assertions of certainly on the alleged mobile biological labs. The CIA had earlier said it has five human sources for the claim, Powell remembered. Now Tenet was saying there was no consensus: ""And I must tell you that we are finding discrepancies in some claims made by human sources about mobile biological weapons production before the war."" <BR><BR>Powell let out another holy shit! He knew very well that Tenet had told the president ""in brash New York language,"" as Powell once put it, that the case on WMD was a ""slam dunk."" <BR><BR>The president was the most visible manifestation of someone who had bought in. Powell was the second most visible, and he realized he was expendable. He knew that Tenet felt bad, and that as director he was looking out for the CIA. But this was a real mess. Powell found himself now asking the most intense and penetrating questions about anything the CIA said or told him. <BR><BR>Powell did not share [Richard] Armitage's concern that the two of them had been enablers for the Cheney–Rumsfeld hard-line policies.

The first part of the operation entailed contacting Iraqi scientists who were outside Iraq and paying them to see if they knew anything about WMD programs. The second part, which was more dangerous, involved paying Iraqis in Europe or Asia to go back into Iraq and talk with their relatives who had been involved in WMD programs in the past. <BR><BR>It hadn't turned up any evidence of WMD, but the CIA was so convinced that Iraq had the weapons that absence of evidence was taken as proof that the Dead Souls–style program wasn't working.

First of all, I expected to find the weapons.

They could have been destroyed during the war. Saddam and his henchmen could have destroyed them as we entered into Iraq. They could be hidden. They could have been transported to another country, and we'll find out. That's what the Iraqi Survey Group—let me—let me finish here. <BR><BR>But David Kay did report to the American people that Saddam had the capacity to make weapons.

It's too late if they become imminent. It's too late in this new kind of war, and so that's why I made the decision I made. <BR><BR>Russert: Mr. President, the director of the CIA said that his briefings had qualifiers and caveats, but when you spoke to the country, you said ""there is no doubt.""

And many of them have chemical and biological weapons programs where they have actually weaponized these weapons, and second, most of them or some of them have very aggressive programs to develop nuclear weapons; certainly Iran does, certainly Iraq does, and there are others including North Korea.

They’re perfectly willing to kill thousands of innocent men, women, and children by flying airplanes into buildings.

Was that at all part of your mission here to convince them of taking military action? </P>  <P>Powell: No, that was not a subject for the G-8 ministerial meeting.

But we discussed with our friends around the world, through all of the ministers here from the G-8, why we think that is important. But, at the moment, the president does not have a military plan on his desk and he is not ready to make any decisions beyond those decisions that are now to our friends.

It was a limited constraint or containment policy, but it was never perfect. </P>  <P><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Furthermore, the nexus between terrorist networks and a terrorist state with weapons of mass destruction, it’s perfectly possible for Saddam Hussein to work with a terrorist network, arrange for them to have the biological weapons. They have sleeper cells around the world, and to use them without a return address. Suicide bombers are not deterred, they’re proud. They think they’re going to heaven. So the deterrent argument would be wonderful if there were something like that that worked.

The problem is, he can’t do it himself. He needs others to do it, and I would think that the Iraqi military and the linkages he has to those weapons ought to be very, very careful about thinking about using them. The concern of the United States is those weapons. The concern of the United States is the regime at the top.

What would you say to him? </P>  <P>Rumsfeld: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Well, the global war on terrorism is important, and this is a part of it. It is the nexus between an Al Qaeda type network and other terrorist network and a terrorist state like Saddam Hussein who has those weapons of mass destruction.

1245,2002-11-10,"Secretary of State Colin Powell, Op-Ed in <EM>The Washington Post</EM>","<P>On September 12, President Bush went before the United Nations and challenged the Security Council to meet its responsibility to act against the threat to international peace and security posed by Iraq. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>The council’s unanimous passage of Resolution 1441 was a historic step for the United Nations toward ridding Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction by peaceful means.</SPAN> </P>  <P>The international community has given Saddam Hussein and his regime one last chance. It is now for Baghdad to seize it. </P>  <P>Seven weeks of consultation, debate, and negotiation in the Security Council only forged a deeper agreement and a stronger resolve among the world that Iraq must fully and finally disarm. It should now be clear to Saddam Hussein that this is not just a matter between Iraq and the United States, but between Iraq and a united world. </P>  <P>After 11 years of flouting dozens of U.N. resolutions and statements, Hussein’s contempt for the international community is obvious. We are all well acquainted with the tactics of denial, deceit and delay that he has used time and again to avoid compliance. We are also well aware of the brutal and aggressive nature of his regime. He has twice invaded his neighbors, and he has used chemical weapons not just against other countries but against his own citizens: men, women, and children. </P>  <P><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>During the four years since inspectors have been barred from Iraq, Hussein has done everything he can to acquire and develop more weapons of mass destruction—whether biological, chemical, or nuclear. He has no scruples about using the weapons that he possesses or about providing them to terrorists should that suit his interests.</SPAN> </P>  <P>Long experience with Saddam Hussein and his regime tells us that he will respond only when confronted with steadfast resolve and the threat of force. Every member of the Security Council understands that if Hussein fails to comply with Resolution 1441, there must be serious consequences. </P>  <P>The words of the resolution are unambiguous: </P>  <UL class=custom_list>  <LI>The Security Council has found Iraq in material breach of its solemn obligations.   <LI>Iraq has been given one week to state whether it intends to comply with Resolution 1441.   <LI>Iraq must produce a comprehensive declaration of its weapons programs.   <LI>Iraq must submit to an inspection regime that is far tougher and far more thorough than ever before.</LI></UL>  <P>Saddam Hussein must give the inspectors immediate, unimpeded, unconditional, and unrestricted access to uncover the weapons of mass destruction that he has had so many years to hide. Access not just to places such as presidential palaces, but to people and other sources of information will be critical, because you have to know where and when to look in order to find biological and chemical weapons that are easy to conceal and move. Without access to key people and information, the inspectors would have to search under every roof and in the back of every truck. </P>  <P>The chief U.N. inspector, Hans Blix, and the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, have been given the robust regime they need. The United States will support the inspectors in every way. Other U.N. members will do the same. </P>  <P>The disarmament process must now begin. The first inspectors plan to arrive in Iraq one week from tomorrow. The world will be watching. The inspectors are required to update the Security Council 60 days after inspections start. Inspectors also are required to inform the council whenever they encounter interference or obstacles. As President Bush said on Friday, U.S. policy will be one of zero tolerance. </P>  <P>In the days and weeks of inspections that lie ahead, the international community can expect Iraq to test its will. Backing Resolution 1441 with the threat of force will be the best way to not only eliminate Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction, but also to achieve compliance with all U.N. resolutions and reach our ultimate goal: an Iraq that does not threaten its own people, its neighbors, and the world. </P>  <P><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>President Bush and both houses of Congress have emphasized that the United States prefers to see Iraq disarm under U.N. auspices without a resort to force. We do not seek a war with Iraq, we seek its peaceful disarmament. But we will not shrink from war if that is the only way to rid Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction.

1246,2002-11-14,"Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, Interview on CBS’s <EM>Infinity Radio</EM>","<P>Steve Kroft: Well, thank you. </P>  <P>There are many questions, and I would like to ask the first one, if it’s all right. U.N. weapons inspectors are preparing to go to Iraq very shortly and begin searching for evidence of Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction. What do you expect them to find, and what happens if they don’t find anything? Is Saddam Hussein off the hook? </P>  <P>Rumsfeld: <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>Well, we know that Saddam Hussein has chemical and biological weapons. And we know he has an active program for the development of nuclear weapons. I suppose what it would prove would be that the inspections process had been successfully defeated by the Iraqis if they find nothing. That’s what one would know if that turned out to be the case. There’s no question but that the Iraqi regime is clever. They have spent a lot of time hiding things, dispersing things, tunneling underground, taking documentation, and moving it to different locations in the past, preventing inspectors from getting access, listening in on what inspectors intend to do. And before the inspectors arrive to do it, seeing that what was there is moved or the effort is frustrated in some way.</SPAN> </P>  <P>[text omitted]</P>  <P>Kroft: Mr. Secretary, we’ve also, in addition to phone calls, we’ve gotten emails, and I want to read one to you: “I’m the parent of an Army Reserve soldier who has already gone through his training and is on the next call up list to be deployed to the Persian Gulf area within the next few weeks, for a period of six months to two years. I’m not yet convinced that Iraq is such an imminent threat to the United States that it justifies having my son placed in harm’s way. If I were there in person, speaking to you, what would you say to convince me?” </P>  <P>Rumsfeld: Well, first, we’re grateful that your son is serving, and wants to serve. And I can’t help but recognize the feelings that a parent has. What would I say to you? Well, I would look you in the eye and I would say, go back before September 11th and ask yourself this question, was the attack that took place on September 11th an imminent threat the month before, or two months before, or three months before, or six months before? When did the attack on September 11th become an imminent threat? When was it sufficiently dangerous to our country that had we known about it that we could have stepped up and stopped it and saved 3,000 lives? Now, transport yourself forward a year, two years, or a week, or a month, <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>and if Saddam Hussein were to take his weapons of mass destruction and transfer them, either use them himself, or transfer them to the Al Qaeda, and somehow the Al Qaeda were to engage in an attack on the United States, or an attack on U.S. forces overseas, with a weapon of mass destruction you’re not talking about 300, or 3,000 people potentially being killed, but 30,000, or 100,000 of human beings.</SPAN> So the question is, when is it such an immediate threat that you must do something, is a tough question. But if you think about it, it’s the nexus, the connection, the relationship between terrorist states and weapons of mass destruction with terrorist networks that has changed our lives, and changed the security environment in the world. And right now in the Congress the intelligence committees in the House and the Senate are working very hard, trying to connect the dots as to who knew what before September 11th, how might it have been stopped. Our task, your task as a mother, and as a citizen, as a voter, and my task, is to try to connect the dots before something happens, not afterwards. People say, well where’s the smoking gun? Well, we don’t want to see a smoking gun from a weapon of mass destruction. We have an obligation to try to defend the people of our country and the interests we have, and that is why the president went to the United Nations and sought a resolution, and received unanimous support to try to see if we can’t get a peaceful solution to the Iraqi problem. </P>  <P>[text omitted]</P>  <P>Caller: Mr. Rumsfeld, I think most Americans love the work you’re doing, and we respect you for it. One of the questions I have for you is, can you elaborate a little bit about the connection between Al Qaeda and Iraq, as I think a lot of Americans are sort of perplexed by the lack of information we have about that, and could you just make that connection a little clearer for us? </P>  <P>Rumsfeld: Well, Chris, it is—the reason people are perplexed is because it is perplexing. <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>The terrorist states, one of which is Iraq. Another is Iran, and Libya, and Syria, and Korea, and Cuba, and they’re all on the terrorist state list, have varying relationships with these so-called terrorist networks, Hezbollah, Hamas, and Al Qaeda, and six or eight others. In some cases, the relationships are quite well known, and well defined.</SPAN> For example, Iran works with Hezbollah, and against Israel, and sends weapons, and terrorists down into Damascus, and down into Beirut, Lebanon, and down into Israel to engage in terrorist acts. </P>  <P>In other cases, it’s rather mysterious, the relationship is, and they don’t advertise it or publicize it. In some cases, it’s because they’re ideologically oriented, and agree with each other. In some cases, they have marriages of convenience, where they have a common enemy, so that even though they may be different philosophically, or religiously, their common enemy brings them together and they work together on things. </P>  <P>I think that what I’ve done is, I see, of course, a lot of classified information, and what I’ve done is to go to the Central Intelligence Agency, and ask them, what is it that we can say about a relationship or a situation that is not going to damage our sources and methods, and expose anyone to harm, or reduce our ability to gather additional intelligence? <SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>And when that information comes back, I tended to almost repeat it word-for-word. And in the case of the relationship between Iraq and Al Qaeda, the words that have come back as being appropriate for release publicly are something like this: That the relationship—that our understanding of the relationship between Iraq and Al Qaeda is still developing. That there is no question but that there have been interactions between the Iraqi government, Iraqi officials, and Al Qaeda operatives. They have occurred over a span of some eight or ten years to our knowledge. There are currently Al Qaeda in Iraq. It is less hard— </SPAN></P>  <P><SPAN class=HIGHLIGHTED>It is not possible for me to elaborate as to exactly what the linkage between the people in Iraq who are known Al Qaeda operatives, and the Iraqi Intelligence Service is. While I can’t comment on that, I can say that if you’re living in a dictatorship that’s repressive, that is as controlling as the Saddam Hussein regime is, it’s hard for one to believe that there would be senior people from the Al Qaeda in that country and have the regime not be aware of them.
